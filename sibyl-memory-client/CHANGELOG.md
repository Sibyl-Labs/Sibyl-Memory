## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-31

One release: the paid tier R2 line, the shipped 0.9.0 family fixes it was built beside, the graph line (tiered retrieval and relations) and the release merge items below.

### Release summary
- Typed links between entities, reference documents and state (`link`, `unlink`, `neighbors`,
  `links_of`; schema v6 `memory_links`). Existing `entity_relations` rows are copied once, on first
  open, in one transaction; nothing existing is rewritten, and a 0.9.0 client still opens the store.
- Reference documents: paged read, list and delete. Tier-aware search with a token output budget.
- `doc_neighborhood`: a document's owning hubs and small-hub siblings (used by MCP `memory_recall`).
- Pro: skill signals (tool names and hashes only, local) feed workflow proposals.
- `MemoryClient(telemetry=False)` turns the usage count off for one client.

### Release merge (2026-10-28)
- Recall neighborhood (from the hopfix line): `MemoryClient.doc_neighborhood`, `_links.owners_of`,
  `hub_members`, `doc_neighborhood`; `output_budget` drops `owners_total` in its counts-only stage.
- Two retrieval flags, both default OFF (they reproduce the agent-bench harness configuration):
  `SIBYL_MEMORY_RANKED_FALLBACK=1` (a short multi-record result is filled with ranked candidates,
  `match: "ranked"`, verdict `ranked_appended`, code `ranked_fallback` when no gated row existed;
  tuning `SIBYL_MEMORY_RANKED_MIN_TOKENS`, `SIBYL_MEMORY_RANKED_EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES`) and
  `SIBYL_MEMORY_HOP_OWNERS=1` (a document's link sample lists its owning hubs first, `owners_total`).
  Unset, the verdict envelope keeps its 19 keys. Documented in the README.
- `telemetry: bool | None = None` on `MemoryClient.__init__` and `MemoryClient.local`: False selects
  the null heartbeat; None or True follow `SIBYL_MEMORY_TELEMETRY` (on unless "0").
- Known limit, large stores: `count_touching` scans a tenant's edges per entity insert (felt near
  111k edges) and the search shadow triggers scan at about 680k rows. Not fixed in this release.
- Tests: `test_hopfix_neighborhood_2026_10_28.py` (8), `test_hopfix_flags_2026_10_28.py` (8),
  `test_upgrade_0_9_0_store_2026_10_28.py` (4: the 0.9.0 fixture and a store the 0.9.0 client
  creates; base tables hashed before and after, second open a no-op, the 0.9.0 client reads and
  searches the upgraded file, a crash inside the copy rolls back), `test_telemetry_param_2026_10_28.py` (5).

### Paid tier R2: skill signals (built 2026-09-29)

Spec plugin-paid-tier-r2-spec-2026-09-29 section 1 (skill signals). Follow-up release to 0.9.0;
minor, no break. BYOK drafting (spec section 2) is not in this release (operator 2026-09-29):
proposals stay fully local with the deterministic draft.

### Changed (tier convention, 2026-10-05; carried from 0.9.0)
- The shared `tiers` module (free / pro / elite, legacy labels as input aliases, an unrecognised
  label is Free with reason `tier_unknown`) is carried from 0.9.0 / 0.5.0 unchanged (cherry-picked
  onto this line; no conflict in the client). See the 0.9.0 entry. Suite 866 + 11 skipped ->
  903 + 11 skipped.

### Added
- `lifecycle.signals`: the Pro skill-signal recorder and its file `~/.sibyl-memory/signals.json`
  (0600, atomic, symlink-refusing, read bounded at 64 KB, a damaged file is empty, written under
  `lifecycle.lock`). Tool events keep the tool name (64 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]`) and
  `arg_shape`, the first 12 hex of sha256 over the sorted TOP-LEVEL argument key names; never a
  value, a nested key, a key name in plain text, a result, a path or a prompt. Entity writes
  (`set_entity`, `delete_entity`, `archive_entity`) keep only `sha256(tenant:category:name)[:16]`.
  N-grams of 3 to 5 tool calls with day buckets, per-session counts and recent timestamps.
  Bounds on every write and load: 200 n-grams (lowest count, then oldest, evicted), 14-day
  drop under 3 hits, 30-day drop for everything and 30 days after a proposal, 7 day buckets,
  200 entity keys of 32 writes, 7-day write retention, 64 KB file cap.
- Recording is armed only on a verified paid entitlement (`automation_allowed`); free and locked
  devices create no buffer and no file. `lifecycle.json` `skills.signals` turns it off;
  `skills.signals_since` is a floor moved by `on` and `clear`, so a running process can never
  write back what was cleared and a transcript is never read back over the time it was off.
- `SignalBuffer` (one per home and process): cheap `note_tool` / `note_entity_write`, flushed at
  most every 30 s or 20 events and at exit. `record_transcript` / `read_slice`: the Claude Code
  Stop hook's incremental transcript slice (stored byte offset and a hash of the path in the
  session's `lifecycle.json` entry, at most 4 MiB per call, complete lines only, offset reset on
  a changed or truncated transcript, sidechain entries skipped).
- The client's write path (`_note_lifecycle_write`, only for clients a plugin surface enabled)
  records entity writes; writes inside `suppressed()` (capsules, trims, the Hermes journal, the
  learner) are not recorded.
- Learner: `Learner.run(signals=)` runs two new detectors, also when the journal has nothing new.
  `tool_sequence`: 3 times in one session, or 5 times in 7 days across 2 sessions; all-identical
  names and memory-read-only sequences excluded; the longest gram wins over a contained gram seen
  no more often, and the windows of one loop are one pattern; confidence 0.60 + 0.05 per hit
  over 3, +0.05 across sessions, cap 0.85; slug `seq-<t1>-<t2>-<t3>` (`mcp__x__y` -> `x-y`), plus
  4 hex of the shapes when two sequences share names but not shapes. `correction_loop`: 3
  rewrites of one entity in one session spanning at least 10 minutes, or a delete/archive then a
  write within 24 h; confidence 0.65, 0.75 across sessions; slug `fix-<category>-<name>` when the
  hash resolves against the entities in `memory.db` at run time (one bounded SELECT), else
  `fix-<hash8>` and "an entity that has since been removed". Synthetic evidence (`event_id` null,
  timestamp, one-line snippet); the local-deterministic summarizer has a body for each kind.
  `LearningRunReport.signal_keys`.
- `proposals.KINDS` gains `tool_sequence` and `correction_loop` (mute works for both);
  `is_relevant` waives the two-sessions span rule for `tool_sequence` and (R2F-N1)
  `correction_loop`; `run_learner` loads the snapshot (nothing when recording is off) and marks
  the tool sequences that became a proposal.
- `testing.REAL_HOME_WATCHED` includes `signals.json`.

### Tests
- `tests/test_signals_2026_09_29.py` (29): canaries in argument values and key names, entity
  names and search queries never on disk; free, locked, SDK and suppressed writes record nothing;
  off, on and clear; every bound; damaged, oversize, planted and symlinked files; 0600; two
  processes flushing under the lock; the import-graph source guard (no network module imports
  the signals module, the module imports no network library, importing the client does not load
  it).
- `tests/test_learning_signals_2026_09_29.py` (18): both detectors' thresholds, exclusions,
  longest gram and loop rules, slugs, confidence, resolved and removed naming, summarizer bodies,
  `Learner.run(signals=)`, muted kinds, blocked slugs and the 30-day cool-off, the span waiver,
  the pending line, a valid SKILL.md and reference copy, `run_learner` marking proposals, and
  a canary entity named only in `memory.db`.

### Changed (R2 check fixes, 2026-09-30)
- R2F-N1: `correction_loop` joins the span-rule waiver. Its detector fires at 10 minutes in one
  session; `is_relevant` still demanded 30, so loops between 10 and 30 minutes were detected and
  then never named. The detector's own thresholds are the gate; confidence, evidence count,
  recency, the anchor and muting still apply.
- R2F-N2: `signals.json` no longer carries an `entity_proposed` map (it was written by
  `mark_proposed` and never read; the learner's slug rules already stop a re-proposal).
  `mark_proposed(home, ngram_keys, *, now)` takes no entity keys. A file that still has the key
  loads normally and the next write drops it.
- R2F-N4 (README): the signals file keeps tool and MCP server names in plain text.
- Tests: +2 (`test_learning_signals` N1 case; `test_signals` old-file load), the span-waiver and
  `mark_proposed` tests updated. 866 passed, 11 skipped.

### Tiered retrieval and relations (graph line, built 2026-10-22)

### Added - `output_budget` (2026-10-22)
- `sibyl_memory_client.output_budget`: `shape_hits(hits, fits, snippet_only=True)` (the
  degrade order shared by the MCP server and the Hermes adapter: snippet-hit body prefix
  500 -> 150 -> omitted, snippet -> 250 chars around the match, link `sample` -> counts,
  then trailing hits; the first stage that fits wins, the top hit is always kept),
  `estimate_tokens` (ceil(ascii/4) + one per non-ASCII char), `within`, `budget_from_env`
  (chars; default 45,000) and `token_budget_from_env` (default 22,000). SAVE.md (v1.2.0,
  hash and manifest recomputed): a search result is held to about 22,000 tokens and says
  what it dropped (`verdict.truncated`).

### Fixed - Edge identity, adoption and the v6 copy (V1 panel theme A + migration should-fix, 2026-10-22)
- **Endpoint identity stamp.** `memory_links` gains nullable `from_entity_id` /
  `to_entity_id` (entity endpoints only; reference/state stay NULL) and `updated_at`.
  `link()` and `links=` stamp both ends with the live row ids; re-asserting an edge
  re-stamps it. An edge side is **stale** when it carries a stamp and a live entity
  holds its (category, key) under a different id (archive + re-create, a namesake);
  a side with no live row is dangling, not stale; a NULL stamp is never stale. Edges
  still survive archive (operator decision 1). Read-side contract:
  `_links.STALE_SIDE_SQL` / `_links.stale_sql(alias)` (SQL boolean) and
  `_links.stale_ids(conn, tenant, ids)` (set of stale ids for a page of edges);
  neighbors/links_of render it as `stale: true`.
- `set_entity` on INSERT returns `inherited_links: n`: edges already keyed to the new
  name (written for an earlier row), counted before the call's own `links=`. Absent on
  update. MCP `memory_remember` surfaces it when n > 0.
- `link()` returns `{"id", "created", "changed"}`; `changed` is True only when an
  existing edge's metadata or stamps differed (`updated_at` bumps only then). An
  identical re-link, or an `unlink` that removed nothing, is not counted as a
  lifecycle write. MCP `memory_link` returns `changed`.
- **Stores already at v6** (earlier V1 builds) get the new columns, plus
  `tenant_adoptions.links_audit`, by additive `ALTER TABLE` on open, with the stamp
  backfill, in ONE transaction (crash leaves the store as it was; the next open
  retries). Backfill: the live id only if that row existed when the edge was written,
  else the newest archived row of that name archived after the edge, else NULL.
- **Adoption** no longer moves edges onto a different row that holds the same name.
  Before memory_links moves, each default-tenant edge side whose endpoint is not a live
  default row is resolved in order: (1) its stamp names a live row -> re-pointed to
  that row's current name; (2) unstamped with one audited rename from an earlier
  adoption into this account (0.9.0 or V1) -> the renamed key (replay); two different
  audited renames -> held; (3) unstamped, live in the account AND the account holds a
  `(before sign-in)` twin -> **held** (not moved, recorded); (4) an entity live in the
  account under another identity (stamped id gone, archived in the default tenant, or
  no earlier adoption could have moved it) -> **collision**: renamed with the
  before-sign-in suffix in memory_links and in the archived rows of that name, audited
  as a rename; (5) otherwise moved as is (dangling sides counted). An entity rename
  moves only edges stamped with that row (or unstamped). A rename or re-point that
  would duplicate an existing edge (UNIQUE) **drops the moving copy and audits it**
  instead of rolling the adoption back on every sign-in. When only held edges remain,
  adoption returns `nothing_to_move` with `held_links` and writes no audit row.
- **Audit shape.** `tenant_adoptions.renamed` is again a homogeneous list of key renames
  (`{table, category?, from, to, reason?}`); edge outcomes go in the new
  `links_audit` JSON object `{dropped, held, resolved, dangling}` (each dropped/held
  edge `{id, from, to, relation, metadata, reason}`, reasons `duplicate`,
  `rename_collision`, `twin`, `ambiguous_rename`). `AdoptionResult` gains
  `dropped_links`, `held_links`, `resolved_links`, `dangling_links`
  (`dropped_duplicate_links` kept); `adoption_history()` rows gain `links`.
- `_links.rename_endpoint(..., entity_id=, dropped=)` rewrites per edge; a test asserts
  every function in the package that runs `UPDATE entities SET name` /
  `UPDATE reference_documents SET doc_key` / `UPDATE state_documents SET document_key`
  also calls `rename_endpoint`.
- **v5 -> v6 copy** runs in Python through the same `norm_relation` as `link()`
  (trim + casefold + 64 chars): invalid rows are skipped and counted, never truncated
  into another relation; orphan, cross-tenant and invalid-endpoint rows are skipped
  and counted; rows that fold to one edge keep the earliest id/created_at and merge
  their metadata objects (later key wins); non-object metadata is dropped (edge kept).
  Each side is stamped with the id the relation named. The receipt
  (`source_rows, copied, folded, skipped_orphan, skipped_cross_tenant,
  skipped_bad_endpoint, skipped_bad_relation, metadata_dropped`) is appended to the
  version-6 row's description and logged at INFO (`sibyl_memory_client.storage`).
- Tests: `test_link_identity_2026_10_22.py` (stamp/stale/inherited, updated_at/changed,
  ALTER + atomicity, copy receipt, adoption collision/replay/hold/drop, renamer
  invariant) and `test_cross_version_2026_10_22.py` (0.9.0 from `git archive 708bd89`
  and this client against one store: write, 0.9.0 delete + adopt, V1 reopen + adopt;
  no edge changes identity, the dangling edge is reported).

### `entity_relations` is frozen
As of schema v6 no client code reads or writes `entity_relations` except the one-time
copy into `memory_links`, which runs once, in the transaction that creates
`memory_links`, and never again. Rows any other writer adds afterwards are not copied.
The table stays, unwritten, for downgrade (see below) and is dropped in a later major
release only after a re-copy check finds zero uncopied rows.

### Downgrade and version skew (v6 store opened by the 0.9.0 family)
A v6 store stays readable by client 0.9.0 (and mcp 0.3.0 / hermes 0.5.0 / cli 0.5.0,
which reach it only through that client): every v6 change is an added table, column or
index, which 0.9.0 never reads. What each 0.9.0 action does to a v6 store:

| 0.9.0 component, action | Effect on the v6 store |
|---|---|
| open (any surface) | none; its schema script is `IF NOT EXISTS`; v6 tables, columns, index kept |
| search / recall / list | edges and reference tools invisible; results as 0.9.0 |
| `set_entity` new name | if edges were keyed to that name, they attach by name and read `stale` in V1 |
| `set_entity` update, `set_state`, `set_reference`, journal | none on edges |
| `archive_entity` | same as V1: edges kept, endpoint reads archived |
| `delete_entity` | row deleted, **edges not cascaded**: dangling (lint `dangling-link`, `exists: false`); re-creating the name makes them stale |
| adoption (`sibyl memory adopt`, auto) | renames entity/doc keys without rewriting edges and leaves `memory_links` under the default tenant; V1's next adoption re-points them by stamp or by replaying the audited renames, holds the ambiguous ones, reports dangling ones |
| writes in general | the `entities_tenant_lname` index is maintained (write cost only) |

Index size: `entities_tenant_lname` costs about 55 bytes + the name length per entity
(measured 72 bytes/entity at 17-character names: the 36-character tenant id dominates),
about 0.7 MB per 10,000 entities, counted toward the free-tier cap.

Full revert to a v5 store (only with no V1 process running; back up the file first):

```sql
BEGIN IMMEDIATE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS memory_links;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS entities_tenant_lname;
DELETE FROM sibyl_memory_schema_version WHERE version = 6;
COMMIT;
-- optional, SQLite >= 3.35: ALTER TABLE tenant_adoptions DROP COLUMN links_audit;
```

Resurrection caveat: every edge written under V1 is lost, and if any V1 client opens the
file again it sees a pre-v6 store and re-runs the one-time copy from the frozen
`entity_relations`: edges that were unlinked or deleted under V1 but came from that table
come back. Do not revert a store you intend to reopen with V1; downgrade the packages and
leave the v6 schema in place instead.

### Fixed - V1 panel, graph read side (PANEL-SYNTHESIS themes C, F, 2026-10-22)
- **`neighbors()` no longer scans the tenant.** Each branch is pinned to its endpoint
  index (`INDEXED BY memory_links_from` / `memory_links_to`) and the cursor predicate
  sits inside each branch; before, SQLite drove the union through
  `memory_links_created` (one node at 45k edges: 155 ms -> 0.6 ms on a loaded box; panel
  measured 83.8 ms -> 0.24 ms). Plan test with and without a cursor.
- **`links_of()` (search-hit `links`) is index-only, O(degree).** Operator decision 3:
  one sample edge per (direction, relation), largest group first, out before in, then
  relation name (`by_relation` in the same order), replacing the five newest edges and
  the full-partition window sort (5,000-edge hub: 151 ms -> 8 ms). Counts come from the
  covering endpoint indexes; one representative row per group is read by rowid. A
  constant number of statements whatever the number of nodes. `hub: true` when either
  direction exceeds the lint `hub-degree` threshold (500).
- **Self-loops count once, as out**, in both `links_of` and `neighbors` `degree`
  (was counted in both directions), so out + in = distinct edges and the search hit
  and the walk agree. `direction="in"` still lists a self-loop.
- **Decoration never fails a search.** A `sqlite3.Error`/`StorageError` while reading
  titles or edges (e.g. a dropped memory_links index) returns the hits with
  `links: None` (or `title: None`) and sets `verdict.decoration_note`. The explicit
  walk (`neighbors`, public `links_of`) still raises on a missing index (Fable consult:
  no silent hint-less re-run); lint reports it.
- **`neighbors()` reports the queried node**: `node` carries `exists`, `archived`,
  `status`, `updated_at`, so a mistyped or wrong-case name is distinguishable from an
  isolated node.
- **`stale` on every rendered edge** (`neighbors` edges, `links_of` / search-hit
  samples), always a bool. V1 merge reconciliation: ONE implementation, the identity
  contract `_links.STALE_SIDE_SQL` (stamp set AND a live entity at that
  (category, key) under a different id; dangling and NULL-stamp sides are never
  stale). `neighbors` applies it to the returned page via `stale_ids`; `links_of`
  selects it inline on the sampled rows via `stale_column`. No per-connection
  column cache: the columns are checked per call, so a reader can never lag the
  open-time identity-column ALTER. Test: neighbors, `links_of` and search hits agree
  for re-created, archived, dangling and never-stamped endpoints.
  `stale_ids` probes edges by primary key (`+l.tenant_id`); with the plain tenant clause
  SQLite scanned `memory_links_created`, 14 ms per `neighbors` call at 42k edges
  (now 0.6 ms); plan test added.
- **lint**: `hub-degree` counts in-degree too (`detail.direction`, `in_degree` /
  `out_degree`); new `links-index-missing` (critical) when an endpoint index is gone.

### Added
- Verdict fields `links_ms` (wall time of the hit edge summary, None when no links were
  requested) and `decoration_note` (additive, in `as_dict()`).
- `set_entity(..., links=...)` adds `links: {created, updated, unchanged}` to the returned row
  (updated = an existing edge whose metadata or stamps changed, the same `changed` as
  `link()`; unchanged = an identical re-assert);
  `set_reference` now returns `{key, links}` (`links` None without `links=`; was None).
  `_decorate_hits(..., info=)` reports `links_ms` / `note`.

### Fixed - V1 panel, search and reference themes (PANEL-SYNTHESIS B, D, E, G; 2026-10-22)
- **Release train.** `version = "0.10.0"` (0.9.0 is the published release; the V1
  MCP server imports `count_tiers`, which 0.9.0 lacks). mcp 0.4.0, hermes 0.6.0 and
  cli 0.6.0 require `sibyl-memory-client>=0.10.0`. Upgrade the packages together
  (`sibyl update --apply`); README says so.
- **Prep gate, TERM side whole-document.** On a terminal query the gate still reads
  a reference document's PREP markers in the first 2,000 chars, but its TERM markers
  in the whole document: a head that is pure prep is cleared when the full body
  matches `_TERM_RE` (its `not ` lookbehind re-checked on the full body). Only rows a
  rowid-only FTS pre-screen (`_TERM_FTS_QUERY`, a superset: each marker as word and
  prefix plus the JSON-escape tails) flags have their full body read. "Draft ...
  approved by the board" with the decision at char 10,000 is kept again, as in 0.9.0
  (NOCTURNE exp1 EXP4). The full-body check (`_term_anywhere`) finds the marker
  literals at C speed and runs the anchored regex only there (equivalence pinned).
  Worst case measured: 102k rows with 2,000 draft-headed 20 KB documents on a
  terminal query, p50 ~0.55-0.62 s (was ~0.35-0.39 s, which dropped all 2,000 and
  returned nothing); the standard bench store is unaffected.
- **Stage 0, short exact names.** The `lower(name) = ?` probe runs for names under 4
  chars (IBM, AWS, Bob); the `name_partial` phrase keeps the guard.
- **Exact name vs the negation gate** (operator decision 2). When the whole query is
  exactly an entity's name (or `<category>:<name>`), the `match: "name"` rows survive
  `NEGATION_ABSTAIN` ("Not Invented Here" is reachable); partial names, text rows and
  every other negated query still abstain; `ABSTAINED_ON` is unchanged.
- **`delete_reference`** marks an accepted skill proposal whose `accepted_doc_key` is
  the key `superseded` (key cleared, recorded in `review_note`) in the same
  transaction as the delete. New `delete_reference_details(key)` returns
  `{deleted, edges_removed, proposals_superseded}`; `delete_reference` still returns
  a bool.
- `SAVE.md` (still release v1.2.0, unshipped; hash and manifest recomputed,
  `_skills/CHANGES.md` item 15): `memory_link(from_node, to_node, ...)`; write hubs,
  then members, then documents; set `metadata.status` on documents; forget keeps
  links and a re-created name reconnects them marked `stale`; check whether
  `memory_neighbors` found the node.
- Tests: `test_search_fixes_v1_2026_10_22.py` (20 cases); two tier-aware tests updated to
  the decided behaviour.

### Changed - Agent guidance (tiered-retrieval spec section 3, 2026-10-22)
- `SAVE.md` release v1.2.0 (skills manifest 1.2.0; DEBLOAT.md unchanged): the interface
  table lists all 15 MCP tools with their SDK twins; new "Writing: which tier" (entity =
  a card under about 1 KB, reference = anything read in full with `kind/slug` and
  `metadata.title`, links written with the node and the recommended relation vocabulary,
  state, journal; hubs keep membership in links) and "Reading: top-down" (resolve the name
  with `scope="graph"` and the `match: "name"` hit -> `memory_neighbors` ->
  `memory_get_reference`; zero-verdict recovery; cite reference keys); tier mapping gains
  REFERENCE and LINK rows; Phase 1 writes entity cards with their links and long texts as
  documents. Watermark hash recomputed with the upstream algorithm; `_skills/CHANGES.md`
  item 14. README: the tier table gains LINKS and the gated search, plus a "write a card,
  link the documents, read top-down" section.

### Added - Tier-aware search (tiered-retrieval spec 2.C, 2026-10-22)
- **Stage 0, exact-name resolution.** `multi_record_search` first resolves a query
  that IS an entity name (`lower(name)` equality, ASCII fold, newest first, up to
  5) or `<category>:<name>` (prefix constrains the category; the whole query is
  tried first because names may contain ':'). Those rows lead the result with
  `match: "name"`. Up to 3 more entities whose NAME column holds the query as a
  phrase follow (`name : "<query>"`, name-weighted bm25) with `match:
  "name_partial"`, only for queries of at most 8 words. Skipped for a single
  token under 4 chars. Body text never qualifies a stage-0 row, and an
  abstention (ABSTAINED_ON / NEGATION_ABSTAIN) always wins: stage-0 rows are
  dropped and the abstain verdict is returned unchanged. Stage 0 runs before
  tokenising, so a name made only of short words or stopwords is still found.
  The shard case (a parent card plus many rows whose names contain the parent's
  name) resolves to the parent. sqlite `lower()` folds ASCII only, so non-ASCII
  letters in a name match case-sensitively. New private primitive
  `MemoryClient._name_matches` (account-gated, not usage-tracked).
- Schema: index `entities_tenant_lname ON entities (tenant_id, lower(name))`,
  `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in schema.sql, applied on every open (existing
  stores build it once on their next open). Not part of `_links.V6_DDL`.
- **`scope`** on `multi_record_search`: `"all"` (default) or `"graph"` (entity +
  state). Under `"graph"`, stage 1 recall, df and the corpus count (IDF, recall
  depth) all cover entity + state only, so a token that lives only in documents
  or the journal abstains there; its `explain()` says so ("appears nowhere in the
  entity or state tiers (scope='graph') ... retry with scope='all'"). Unknown
  scope -> `ValidationError`. `_recall_token` takes `tiers=`.
- **Hit fields** on every `multi_record_search` hit: `match` ("name" |
  "name_partial" | "text"), `chars` (full surfaced body length), `title`
  (reference `metadata.title`, else None), and with `with_links=True` a `links`
  summary `{degree: {out, in}, by_relation: {rel: n}, sample: [{relation,
  direction, node}][:5]}` (None on journal hits). New private
  `MemoryClient._decorate_hits` (one keyed title read + one links statement for
  all hits). The raw `search()` / `search_entities()` primitives stay link-free.
- **Verdict** (additive keys, no new zero cause): `tiers_hit` (returned rows per
  tier, filled by `stamp()` on every surface), `name_matches` (rows from stage 0;
  None on the raw primitives), `recall_depth` (K; None when stage 1 did not
  run), `scope`. `explain()` on a GATED zero within 0.1 of the floor names the
  depth: "The best row reached 0.41 against the 0.45 floor at depth 2,100."
  New helpers `verdicts.count_tiers`, `NEAR_FLOOR_BAND`, `HIT_TIERS`.

### Changed - Tier-aware search (2.C)
- **Tie-break at equal coverage:** `_TIER_PRIORITY` entity 0, state 0,
  reference 0 -> 1, journal 1 -> 2. Coverage still sorts first. The raw path's
  rank tie-break (`_search_strict`, `_candidate_ids`) uses the same values via
  the new module constant `client._TIER_RANK`. On the frozen 3,000-row golden
  corpus this reorders rows of equal coverage only (row sets identical at full
  depth); at `limit=10` it can move a reference row below the cut when more than
  ten rows tie.
- `_links.links_of` is now ONE statement (window functions: per-node sample
  numbering, per-(direction, relation) group counts) instead of two; same output.
  Its two halves are `want CROSS JOIN memory_links INDEXED BY memory_links_from /
  memory_links_to`: without that, SQLite drove the "in" half through
  `memory_links_created (tenant_id=?)`, a scan of every edge in the tenant per call
  (54 ms -> 0.7 ms for 10 nodes at 26k edges; this also affected 2.B's
  `client.links_of`). A plan test pins the per-node key lookups.
- The stage-0 equality probe carries no `ORDER BY` (rows are ordered newest-first
  in Python): with `ORDER BY updated_at` SQLite chose `entities_updated_at` and
  scanned the tenant (57 ms at 100k rows) instead of the `entities_tenant_lname`
  lookup. A plan test pins the index.
- Tests: `test_tier_aware_search_2026_10_22.py` (26). The 0.9.0 golden test
  compares with the old tie-break patched back in and the new hit/verdict keys
  stripped (fixture unchanged); `test_tie_break_only_reorders_equal_coverage_rows`
  proves identical row sets at full depth and that every moved pair is a
  higher-priority tier moving ahead. The verdict envelope key-set test lists the
  four new keys.

### Added - Reference tier read surface (tiered-retrieval spec 2.A, 2026-10-22)
- `read_reference(key, *, offset=0, max_chars=20000)`: paged read of a reference document.
  Returns `{key, body, offset, chars, next_offset, metadata, updated_at}` or None. Offsets count
  characters (code points), so a page never splits a character; `offset >= chars` returns an empty
  body with `next_offset` None. A negative offset or `max_chars < 1` raises `ValidationError`.
- `list_references(*, prefix=None, limit=100, cursor=None)`: `{items: [{key, chars, metadata,
  updated_at}], next_cursor}` in key order, bodies never loaded. The cursor is opaque (keyset on
  the key). The prefix is literal and case-sensitive, implemented as the key range
  `[prefix, successor(prefix))` on the primary key rather than the spec's `LIKE ... ESCAPE`,
  because SQLite `LIKE` is ASCII case-insensitive and would list `doc/x` for prefix `Doc/`.
- `delete_reference(key) -> bool`: hard delete, tenant scoped. It is a write op: listed in
  `_entitlement.WRITE_OPS`, `lifecycle.state.WRITE_OPS` and the lifecycle write kinds (the
  equality test covers all three), so it is refused under the computer-limit read-only policy.
- Every new method carries `_track_op` (account gate first).

### Fixed
- `set_reference` with a `str` body now enforces the 1 MiB per-value bound (UTF-8 bytes), like
  dict/list bodies. The `str` branch skipped `_check_json`, so a paid caller could write one
  unbounded string. A string with an unpaired surrogate is a `ValidationError` instead of a
  storage error. `get_reference` and `set_reference` signatures are unchanged.
- Not in this change: the spec's 4 KB reference-metadata bound is enforced on the MCP write tool
  only; product writers (Pro debloat history) can carry larger metadata, so the SDK bound waits
  for a measurement.

### Added - Relations (tiered-retrieval spec 2.B)
- Schema v6: `memory_links`, typed directed edges between entity / reference / state nodes,
  keyed by business keys (entity `category`+`name`, reference `doc_key`, state `document_key`;
  `''` category for non-entities, enforced by CHECK). Indexes on both endpoints and on
  `(tenant_id, created_at, id)` for the keyset cursor. `count_rows('memory_links')` allowed.
- Migration for existing stores: on the first open of a pre-v6 store, `memory_links` is created
  and every `entity_relations` row is copied (both ids resolved inside the row's own tenant,
  `relation_type` case-folded, id and `created_at` kept) in ONE transaction before the schema
  script runs, so the table's existence is the crash-atomic "copied" marker (an unlinked edge
  is never resurrected). `entity_relations` stays, unwritten, until R4. Nothing gates on the
  version-6 row.
- `MemoryClient.link` / `unlink` / `neighbors` / `links_of` and the `entity_ref` /
  `reference_ref` / `state_ref` NodeRef helpers. `link` is strict (both endpoints must exist
  in the caller's tenant, `NotFoundError` names the side), idempotent, upserts metadata
  (`None` keeps it); relation case-folded, <= 64 chars; edge metadata <= 4 KB. `neighbors`:
  direction / relation / other-tier / other-category filters, keyset pagination on
  `(created_at, id)`, limit clamped to [1, 200], optional 200-char preview; a self-loop is
  listed once (as "out") under "both". `links_of`: batch summary in two statements.
- `links=` on `set_entity` and `set_reference`: the node and its outgoing edges are written in
  one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; a missing target rolls back the node write too. At most
  1,000 edges per call. Edge bytes count toward the free-tier cap (pre-write estimate and the
  CAP-2 in-transaction recheck).
- `link` and `unlink` are write ops (`WRITE_OPS`, lifecycle counting, refused under
  `policy_read_only`); `neighbors` and `links_of` are reads. All four carry `_track_op`.
- Lint: `hub-degree` (warning, > 500 out-edges), `dangling-link` (warning; info when the
  endpoint is archived), `reference-orphan` (one info summary, only once the tenant has edges).
  `counts` gains `memory_links`.

### Changed - Relations
- `delete_entity` deletes every edge touching the entity in the same transaction.
  `archive_entity` keeps them; `neighbors` reports the archived endpoint with
  `tier: "entity"` (still a usable NodeRef), `exists: false`, `archived: true`,
  `status: "archived"`, `archived_at` (spec text said `tier: "archive"`; changed so the ref
  stays reusable). Re-creating the entity restores its edges.
- Adoption (`_adopt.py`): a collision rename rewrites both endpoint columns of the moved
  tenant's edges in the adoption transaction; `memory_links` joins `TENANT_TABLES`. A moved
  edge identical to one the account already holds (possible when the account's endpoints are
  archived) is dropped, kept on the account's side, and recorded in the audit row
  (`AdoptionResult.dropped_duplicate_links`) instead of failing the whole move.
- `delete_reference` deletes every edge touching the document in the same transaction
  (`_cascade_node_links(conn, "reference", "", key)`), as `delete_entity` does;
  `test_delete_reference_cascades_edges` runs unconditionally.

### Changed - search scale fixes (tiered-retrieval spec 2.D, 2026-10-22)
- **Recall depth scales with the store.** `multi_record_search` now reads
  `K = clamp(200, ceil(0.05 x rows), 5000)` candidates per query token instead
  of a fixed 200 (`RECALL_FRACTION`, `RECALL_DEPTH_MAX`, `recall_depth()` in
  `multi_record`). At 4,000 rows or fewer K is still 200.
- **True document frequency.** A token's df is now its real per-tier count
  (`count(*)` with MATCH + tenant), not `min(df, 200)`, so IDF and the anchor
  band tell common words apart on large stores. Results are identical to 0.9.0
  wherever no token reached the old cap (200 rows, or 50 journal rows); a
  frozen 3,000-row golden test asserts this.
- **Stage 1 reads ids only.** Per-token recall no longer decodes bodies or
  builds snippets; bodies are loaded once, for the final rows. On a terminal
  query ("approved", "sent", ...) the prep filter's text is loaded in one batch.
- **Entity names weigh more.** Entity search ranks with
  `bm25(entities_fts, 8, 1, 1)` (`NAME_WEIGHT`); reference and state keys with
  weight 4 (`KEY_WEIGHT`). An entity whose name is the query now outranks long
  bodies that only mention it. Rows that do not match in the name score as before.
- **Match-centred snippets.** Hit snippets are 40 tokens (from 12). In
  `multi_record_search` the snippet is centred on the densest match of the
  query words that row matched.
- **Prep filter scope on documents.** On reference documents the
  draft/proposed filter reads `metadata.status` when set, else the first 2,000
  characters, not the whole document.

### Fixed (latency, same day)
- **Batch row loads use the primary key.** The id-list loads behind hydration
  and the prep filter wrote `tenant_id = ? AND rowid IN (...)`; with no ANALYZE
  statistics SQLite drove them through a tenant index and scanned the whole
  tenant once per 500 ids (18 ms per chunk at 100k rows). They now write
  `+tenant_id = ?`: same filter, primary-key lookup (0.9 ms per chunk).
- **The prep filter decodes only rows that can match it.** One rowid-only FTS
  query per tier finds the candidates that carry a prep-marker token (plus
  reference rows whose metadata may hold `status`); every other candidate gets
  the empty prep text, which is the regex's own answer for it. The query is a
  superset of `_PREP_RE` by construction (marker words and prefixes, the
  "in progress" phrase, `\u00XX` escapes, control-character tails); a property
  test over adversarial and random bodies in all four tiers pins it, and the
  results and verdicts are identical with and without the prefilter.
- Small hot-loop trims (candidate accumulation, gate counters). No result,
  order or verdict changes: the 3,000-row golden and every suite are unchanged.
- `scripts/bench_scale_latency.py` reproduces the table below (synthetic
  stores in a temp dir; `--baseline <git ref>` compares another engine).

  p50 ms, 7 runs, shared 4-core box (q15 = 15 planted tokens, q24 = 24 tokens,
  term16 = "approved" + q15, abstain = 8 tokens + one unsupported):

  | rows | class   | 0.9.0 | before | after |
  |------|---------|------:|-------:|------:|
  | 22k  | q15     |    96 |    102 |    83 |
  | 22k  | q24     |   224 |    151 |   140 |
  | 22k  | term16  |   157 |    380 |   103 |
  | 22k  | abstain |    50 |     51 |    45 |
  | 52k  | q15     |   111 |    237 |   197 |
  | 52k  | q24     |   249 |    319 |   291 |
  | 52k  | term16  |   175 |    896 |   242 |
  | 52k  | abstain |    61 |    101 |    97 |
  | 102k | q15     |   183 |    436 |   400 |
  | 102k | q24     |   357 |    617 |   595 |
  | 102k | term16  |   254 |  2,411 |   607 |
  | 102k | abstain |    89 |    205 |   244 |

  Within the spec budget (p50 < 0.6 s at ~55k, < 1.0 s at double) for every
  class. Above ~50k rows the engine is slower than 0.9.0 by design: each token
  now ranks up to 5,000 rows instead of 200 (that depth is what finds the
  planted document 0.9.0 misses), and the FTS rank + tenant check per matched
  row is the floor.

### Known limits
- The inflected-word rescue (shadow index) stays bounded at 200 rows per token
  at every store size; a token with 200 or more direct matches gets none, as in
  0.9.0.
- `NAME_WEIGHT` does not lift a hub whose card is several times the store's
  average row length; exact-name lookup (a later release) covers that case.

## [0.9.0] - Unreleased

Account-gated release (spec account-gated-plugin-spec-2026-09-27). Minor, not
patch: every caller without an activated account now gets `EntitlementError`.

### 2026-10-14 - Pre-release cleanup
- Quickstart in the README now opens the client on your account's tenant (from
  `credentials.json`), so what it writes is what the MCP server, Hermes and LangGraph read. It
  also says what happens without a tenant and how `sibyl memory adopt` moves those rows.
- README: the "What's in v0.4.x" heading is gone and spelling is US English.
- The computer-limit messages build `account.sibyllabs.org/security` from one constant. The text
  is unchanged.
- Docstrings corrected: certifi is not the only dependency, `tier` / `set_tier` are hints that a
  verified entitlement overrides.
- Removed unused internal helpers and imports. No public API changed: `EntitlementGate.state_path`
  has no reader but is kept, because a gate is reachable through the public
  `MemoryClient.entitlement_gate` property.
- The pinned-keys module docstring says where the private signing key lives only in general
  terms (held by the Sibyl Labs api, never in this package); it no longer names internal
  secret storage or release steps. Text only.
- Comments, docstrings, test file names and this CHANGELOG describe each finding by what it fixed
  instead of naming testers or internal QA rounds. Text and test file names only; no code changed.

### 2026-10-10 - sign-in and display fixes
- F-1 (contract C1): `classify_denial` reads the 401 body's `code`. For `signed_out_on_claim`
  the outcome stays `denied` / `signed_out` (the MCP `reason` is unchanged) and carries `cause`
  and `since` (the api's `signed_out_at`, shape-checked ISO, at most 40 characters). The gate
  keeps both in `entitlement.json` (`denied.cause`, `denied.since`), `Decision` and `status()`
  expose them (`cause`, `signed_out_at`), and `require()` raises `EntitlementError("signed_out")`
  with the copy "This computer was signed out of your Sibyl Memory account when your email was
  confirmed on the account page (<date> UTC). Run sibyl init --force ..." and `next: sibyl init
  --force`. Any other 401 is unchanged. New in `exceptions`: `SIGNED_OUT_ON_CLAIM`,
  `clean_iso`, `utc_minute`, `signed_out_on_claim_message`. Tests:
  `tests/test_signed_out_on_claim_2026_10_10.py` (+15). Suite: 899 passed, 11 skipped
  (was 884).

### Fixed (shown tier and plan end, 2026-10-08)
- F1: a verified, bound pass that arrives on a refresh (a blocking `refresh()` or the background
  re-check, both through `_do_refresh`) now rewrites the saved `tier` in `credentials.json`
  (`_entitlement.sync_credentials_tier`), so a computer that signed in on Free and then bought
  Pro, or whose Pro ended, no longer keeps the sign-in-time tier on disk. Canonical labels only
  (an unrecognised label is left alone), no write when the saved tier already normalises to the
  pass's tier, only for the same account and session the pass is bound to, never through a
  symlink; `signature` / `signed_at` are dropped with the edit (a signed field never changes
  under an old signature); mkstemp + fsync + `os.replace` with the file's existing mode; the
  `tier_cache.json` beside it is removed when the tier changed. Never raises.
- F1: `MemoryClient.tier_for_display()` (the pass's tier when the computer holds a valid one,
  else the saved hint; never the tier cache). `free_tier_status()` reports that tier and its cap
  instead of the construction-time hint.
- F2: `EntitlementGate.status()["plan"]` carries the server's additive `ends_at` / `renews_at`
  (ISO strings, at most 40 characters; anything else is dropped). Payloads with keys this
  version does not know were and stay valid passes.
- Tests: `tests/test_tier_sync_2026_10_08.py` (+8); `test_lint.py` paid-tier status uses the
  null gate (the pass now wins over the hint); the track-op coverage guard lists
  `tier_for_display` (no storage access). Suite: 884 passed, 11 skipped (was 876 + 11).

### Fixed (tests, 2026-10-07)
- `test_13_automation_allowed_matrix`: the stale and locked band clients use an
  `EntitlementGate(..., allow_refresh=False)`, so a background refresh cannot re-mint a fresh
  token mid-test (flaked 3 in 40 under CPU load). Test only.

### Added (agent handoff messages, 2026-10-06)
Spec agent-handoff-messages-spec-2026-10-03 (rows C1 to C17, section 1.6; same coordinated release).
- `exceptions.ENTITLEMENT_NEXT` and `exceptions.ENTITLEMENT_HUMAN_ACTION`, beside
  `ENTITLEMENT_MESSAGES` / `ENTITLEMENT_RECOVERY` and keyed by the same eleven codes: the exact
  command an agent runs next (`sibyl init`, `sibyl refresh`, `sibyl init --force`,
  `sibyl email add <address>`, the `pip install -U ...` update, or `done`) and the sentence it
  relays to its person (None when nobody has to act). The single source the MCP server, the
  Hermes adapter and a LangGraph graph read.
- `EntitlementError` gains `.next`, `.human_action`, `.summary` (the section 8 copy, what `str(e)`
  was) and `.handoff_lines()`. `str(e)` is now `summary` followed by the block
  (`ask your human: ...` when a person must act, then `next: ...`, always last), so every surface
  that relays the text carries the handoff. `code`, `reason`, `recovery`, `account_url` and the
  constructor's existing arguments are unchanged; `next=` / `human_action=` are new optional
  keywords.
- The computer-limit read-only refusal (code `policy_read_only`, `acct.devices.over`) carries
  `next` `sibyl devices` and its own sentence (`DEVICES_READ_ONLY_NEXT`,
  `DEVICES_READ_ONLY_HUMAN_ACTION`); the email copy is never named there.
- `CapExceededError`, `TierGateError`, `TierVerificationError`, `TierAuthError` gain the same two
  attributes as class defaults (`sibyl upgrade`, `sibyl upgrade`, `retry`, `sibyl init --force`)
  and `.handoff_lines()`; their `str()` is unchanged. The over-the-cap denial for a plugin too old
  for the server carries the update command instead of `sibyl upgrade`.
- `exceptions.format_handoff(next, human_action)`.
- Tests: `tests/test_handoff_2026_10_03.py` (+22). Suite on the handoff build: 876 passed,
  11 skipped.

### Changed (tier convention, 2026-10-05)
Spec tier-convention-spec-2026-10-05 section 5 (same coordinated release; version unchanged).
- One shared tier module, `sibyl_memory_client.tiers` (stdlib only): the canonical tiers are
  `free`, `pro` and `elite`; `normalize`, `is_paid`, `display` (Free / Pro / Elite), `soft_cap`,
  `PAID_TIERS`, `SOFT_CAPS`, `UNKNOWN_REASON`. Every former copy now routes through it:
  `_capcheck.PAID_TIERS`, `lifecycle.entitled.PAID_TIERS`, `MemoryClient._PAID_ONLY_TIERS` (all
  re-exported under their old names), the `devices_read_only_message` tuple, the lint caps and
  the three five-MiB constants (`FREE_TIER_CAP_BYTES`, `DEFAULT_SOFT_CAP_BYTES`, `SOFT_CAPS[free]`).
- Legacy labels from older servers and credentials (`sync`, `team`, `lifetime`, `stake` -> pro;
  `enterprise` -> elite) are accepted as input-only aliases; tier comparisons are case and
  whitespace tolerant.
- An unrecognised tier label is treated as Free with the reason code `tier_unknown`:
  `decision_allows` answers `(False, "tier_unknown")` (a paid claim answers its canonical tier),
  the paid-feature `TierGateError` names the raw label, and `gate.status()` adds `tier_known`,
  `tier_effective` and the server's `plan` (`acct.plan {tier, src}`) when present. The server
  keeps the authoritative cap, so a write is never lost.
- `lint.TIER_SOFT_CAPS` is now `tiers.SOFT_CAPS` (free, pro, elite); look a label up with
  `tiers.soft_cap()`, which also accepts the aliases.
- Upgrade copy in `TierGateError`, `CapExceededError` and the lint cap finding says Pro instead
  of the retired tier names.
- Tests: `tests/test_tiers_2026_10_05.py` (+37, including the source guard
  `test_no_other_paid_tier_literal`); `test_pro_tier_2026_09_03.py` and
  `test_lifecycle_2026_09_27.py` compare against `tiers.PAID_TIERS` and include elite. Suite
  817 + 11 skipped -> 854 + 11 skipped (measured on the R1 line `accounts-patch` at `53b914e`,
  TCP-3, tests in place: 854 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failed; re-run 2026-10-05 for the TCF check).

### Added (paid tier R1, 2026-09-29, R1B-1)
Plan plugin-paid-tier-2026-09-29, operator defaults D1-D15 (same coordinated release; version unchanged).
- Automatic save by ACTIVE time (Pro): `lifecycle.state` counts active time per session (a gap
  longer than 5 minutes counts as 5; `note_activity`, `add_active`), keeps bounded settings in
  `lifecycle.json` `autosave` (interval 30 to 240 minutes, default 60; at most 8 a session and 12 a
  day; a hand-edited file can only make it rarer), records each request (`record_nudge`), and a
  save anywhere (the shared DB marker) restarts every open session's clock.
  `reminders.autosave_due` is the rule: something to save, and 60 active minutes since the last
  save, or the first-save rule (5 writes) or a compaction; never twice in one active interval.
- `ProcessNotices` (MCP server, Hermes adapter): counts every tool call / turn, gives the
  automatic-save request once per interval (account notice first, then the save request, then the
  skill line), a one-time tier-change line (now on Pro / back on Free), and on Pro runs the local
  learner after the debloat plan in the process-start thread.
- Skill proposals (`lifecycle.proposals`): relevance filter (confidence 0.6, 3 events, 2 in the
  last 7 days, one in the most recent session, two sessions), up to 3 named, once per session and
  24 h; `run_learner` is Pro only, local-deterministic, and its writes are not counted as the
  person's. `Learner.run(exclude_kinds=, unmuted=)`: an accepted slug is never proposed again, a
  rejected one not for 30 days, a twice-rejected one not until unmuted. Evidence keeps the 20 most
  recent events.
- `skills.write_skill`, `proposal_skill_text`, `skill_name`, `validate_skill_text`: an accepted
  proposal becomes a SKILL.md that passes Codex's `quick_validate` rules; recorded in the
  manifest's `accepted` section, never removed by `sibyl skills uninstall`.
- Computer limit: a `mem: read_only` token whose `acct.devices.over` is true raises
  `policy_read_only` with the computer-limit copy (same code, same MCP `reason`);
  `exceptions.device_limit_info`, `devices_read_only_message`. `EntitlementGate.status()` adds
  `cap` and `src`.

### Fixed (paid tier R1 check, 2026-09-29, R1B-4)
- The computer-limit read-only copy says new memories save only on "the computer that signed in
  most recently" (the server's rule: the newest sign-in stays writable), not "the most recently
  used computer".
- `lifecycle`: a compaction is kept on the SESSION (`sessions[..].compaction_seen`, cleared by a
  save), so one session's compaction no longer makes another session due (Pro automatic save and
  the free save reminder); the tenant-level `compaction_seen` / `save_due_now` keys are gone (an
  old file's values are dropped on read). `writes_since_save` stays tenant-wide (plan D6.5).
  `state.next_nudge_seq` / `note_seq_seen`: `record_nudge` returns the sequence number past any
  request the Claude Code transcript already holds.

### Changed (paid tier R1)
- `SAVE.md` (skills v1.1.0, same release): the Codex row is `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with
  the quick_validate rules (was the stale `~/.codex/prompts`); headless mode describes the new
  cadence and says the plugin proposes skills separately; curate mode also walks
  `sibyl skills proposals` (accept only on a yes). Watermark hash and manifest checksum recomputed.
  The SAVE shim says the same.
- The learner's skill body points at `sibyl skills proposals` (there was never a `sibyl learn`).

### Added (save and debloat, 2026-09-27, SD-1 to SD-3)
Spec plugin-save-debloat-spec-2026-09-27 (same coordinated release; version unchanged).
- `sibyl_memory_client.skills` and package data `_skills/SAVE.md`, `_skills/DEBLOAT.md`
  (vendored from the public MIT repos `Sibyl-Labs/sibyl-save` v1.0.0 and `Sibyl-Labs/debloat`
  v1.0.0 with the attribution watermark kept; every adaptation listed in `_skills/CHANGES.md`),
  `_skills/manifest.json`. `install(home)` writes `~/.sibyl-memory/skills/` (0600 files in a
  0700 directory, atomic, symlink-refusing, bounded reads) and never overwrites a person's
  edit: a new version goes beside it as `<name>.upstream-<version>`. `status`, `reset`,
  `canonical_text` (the installed edit wins), harness shims (`shim_text`, `install_shim`,
  `remove_shim`, `uninstall`), all checksum-managed.
- `sibyl_memory_client.lifecycle`: `measure` (a Python port of `context-hygiene.mjs` with the
  same numbers, stat only; a conformance test runs both), `splitter` (pure, loss-free
  HISTORY / CURRENT classification), `apply` (verified backup, history stored through the gated
  client or to a sibling `*-history` file, source rewritten last, undo), `policy`
  (`~/.sibyl-memory/debloat.json`, default `propose`), `state` (`~/.sibyl-memory/lifecycle.json`
  and the write counter), `entitled.automation_allowed` (a verified fresh or stale entitlement
  whose own tier is paid; nothing else), `capsule`, `reminders`, `runner`, `notices`.
- `MemoryClient.enable_lifecycle_counting(home)`: a client the plugin's own surfaces enable (the
  MCP server, the Hermes adapter, `sibyl save --fact`) counts successful writes for the save
  reminder (an in-memory counter flushed at most every 30 s or 10 writes); the save procedure's
  `sibyl_save:last_save` marker resets it. Off by default (SD-7): any other client writes no
  lifecycle file. Counters and timestamps only; nothing about content.
- `testing`: real-home guard helpers (`real_home`, `real_home_snapshot`, `real_home_changes`,
  `assert_home_is_not_real`).

### Tests (save and debloat)
- `test_skills_2026_09_27.py` 16, `test_lifecycle_2026_09_27.py` 65 (incl. the Node conformance
  check against the vendored upstream script, 20 loss-free round trips with CRLF and BOM, the
  refusal matrix, apply ordering under injected failures, the gate matrix, two processes one
  apply), `test_real_home_guard_2026_09_27.py` 4. Every package conftest now asserts HOME is
  never the real home and fails the session if a watched real-home path changed.

### Fixed (second independent check of save and debloat, 2026-09-27, SD-11 to SD-13)
- No data-loss window in `apply_one`: the backup of an apply that did not report success is
  removed only when the source is verifiably the file that was read (same size, mtime, inode
  and device); an interruption right after the atomic rewrite keeps it (and so does a source
  edited during the apply).
- Symlinked folders are resolved, not refused (`apply.resolved_target`, `inside_boundary`): the
  trim reads and writes `realpath(folder)/name`, so no folder on the written path is a symlink;
  only a symlinked FILE is refused; the real location must be under the real home or the real
  project root. `policy.auth_id` and `apply.backup_rel` use the same real-path identity; stored
  `auto_files` entries are re-resolved once, and dropped with the one-time notice when their file
  is gone. `symlinked_ancestor` is removed.
- `run_automatic` names a file set to automatic that it did not trim ("on automatic but not
  trimmed: <file>: <reason>") and records each file's id in `last_apply`.
- The sibling `*-history` append is idempotent across days (compared on the history body under
  any dated "moved from <name>" header).
- `CapGate.decides_locally()` is True only for a fresh, account-matched, trusted UNCAPPED tier
  cache (a capped answer depends on the real write size, which a hook cannot bound).
- The SAVE shim describes `headless` as the once-per-session Pro nudge (first turn end after 5
  memory writes or a compaction), not "at session end"; installed shims refresh through the
  checksum path.

### Tests (second independent check)
- `test_sd_final_2026_09_27.py` (16); `test_sd_fixes_2026_09_27.py` F1 (migrated ids need an
  existing file), F2 (symlinked folders resolved; a real location outside home is refused) and F5
  (capped is never local) adjusted.

### Fixed (independent check of save and debloat, 2026-09-27, SD-7 to SD-10)
- Automatic context trim is authorised per FILE PATH (`policy.auth_id`: the normalised absolute
  path, `~/<rel>` under home) and matched on the candidate's path only; a name authorised in one
  project no longer trims the same name in every other project or `~/CLAUDE.md`. Name-only entries
  from the earlier build are dropped with a one-time notice (`policy.take_legacy_notice`).
- `apply` refuses, before anything is written, a file below a symlinked folder (any ancestor).
- Bounded growth: an apply that does not rewrite its file removes its backup; at most 20 backups
  per file; `plans/` keeps 50; `debloat/history.jsonl` rotates past 256 KB. Backups of a project
  file are keyed by its absolute path (the shared `project/<name>` slot let an undo in one project
  restore another project's file).
- `undo(prefer=)` restores the backup the last apply recorded (now kept in `last_apply`) and
  refuses a backup identical to the current file.
- The sibling `*-history` append is idempotent.
- Write counting is opt-in (`enable_lifecycle_counting`); the exit hook registers on the first
  counted write.
- `EntitlementGate(allow_refresh=False)` (never refreshes: for processes a harness kills after a
  few seconds); `CapGate.decides_locally()` (would `check()` decide without the network).
- `run_automatic(allow_apply=, deadline=)` (plan-only when a write could wait on the network or
  the time budget is used); stale `.<name>.*.sibyl-tmp` files next to a candidate are swept.
- Skill text: `SAVE.md` says Codex gets a marked block in its global AGENTS.md plus a skill (never
  a custom prompt), and when the Pro save nudge comes (R1 replaced that rule with the active-time
  cadence above); `DEBLOAT.md` explains `sibyl:keep` for live sections that look like
  history and that `auto` is per file path. Watermark hashes and manifest checksums recomputed.
- Codex gets the same SKILL.md shim frontmatter as Claude Code and Hermes.

### Tests (independent check of save and debloat)
- `test_sd_fixes_2026_09_27.py` (F1 per-path authorisation incl. the cross-repo and home cases,
  F2 symlinked folders, F3 bounds, F4 undo, F5 no-refresh gate and `decides_locally`, F10 opt-in
  counting, F12 idempotent sibling, the tmp sweep, the `sibyl:keep` advice); adjusted lifecycle,
  skills and coverage-guard tests.

### Fixed (independent check fix batch, 2026-09-27, GATE-15)
- **`mem: none` scheduled no refresh.** The server-policy lock was the only
  locked branch that never asked the server again, so a lifted policy (email
  confirmed) reached the device only after a restart and a full exp. It now
  schedules the same throttled background refresh as the other locked
  branches (at most once per `LOCKED_RETRY_SECONDS`; a server rejection forces
  one).
- **The automatic adoption was silent.** When the first gated operation moves
  rows written before sign-in, the client now gives out a one-time notice
  through the existing notice path (`_consume_notice`): "N memories written
  before sign-in were moved into your account on this computer." ("1 memory
  ... was moved" for one). Counts only, never a key, a body or an account id.
  `entitlement_notice()` returns it first (MCP shows it in its `notice`
  field); new `adoption_notice()` returns only it (hermes logs it). Given out
  once per client; the move itself happens once per account per store, so a
  rebuilt client says nothing.
- README privacy paragraph: the size check and the usage count also carry
  this computer's signed access token (account id, tier, cap, device hash,
  account flags; no personal data).
- Tests: `test_release_fixes_2026_09_27.py` 9 (all fail before);
  `test_every_public_memory_method_carries_track_op` allowlists the new
  `adoption_notice` accessor (it reads no storage).

### Fixed (gate fix before the independent check, 2026-09-27)
- **Memory written before sign-in was invisible after sign-in.** Pre-account
  installs stored rows under `DEFAULT_TENANT`; after `sibyl init` every surface
  resolves the account tenant, and nothing re-tenanted them (`sibyl migrate`
  does not). New `_adopt.py`: on the first gated operation of a client whose
  tenant is the `ten`/`sub` of the entitlement the gate just verified, every
  `DEFAULT_TENANT` row in all eleven tenant-scoped tables moves to the account
  tenant in ONE local transaction (a crash rolls it all back), ids, bodies and
  timestamps unchanged, nothing deleted, no network. Conflict rule: a business
  key the account already has (`entities (category, name)`,
  `state_documents.document_key`, `reference_documents.doc_key`) keeps the
  account's row and the moved row is renamed `<key> (before sign-in)` (then
  `(before sign-in 2)`, ...); an accepted skill proposal follows its renamed
  reference doc. The external-content FTS tables and the search shadow follow
  through their UPDATE triggers; the standalone journal FTS and the journal
  rows of the search shadow are re-keyed explicitly. An audit row (counts and
  renamed keys, never bodies) lands in the new `tenant_adoptions` table (schema
  v5) in the same transaction, plus a `seen` row the first time an account uses
  a store, so the automatic move happens on an account's FIRST sign-in only and
  never when the store has held another account (data under another tenant or
  an audit row for another account): that case needs
  `MemoryClient.adopt_pre_signin_memory(confirm_other_accounts=True)` /
  `sibyl memory adopt`, which asks. `MemoryClient.adoption` reports what the
  automatic pass did.
- **Bootstrap grace could be had, and restarted, with local files.** The 7-day
  legacy bootstrap grace (spec D10) was anchored on `first_seen_legacy` in
  `entitlement.json`: fabricated credentials with the api blocked got 7 days,
  and deleting the file restarted them. `BOOTSTRAP_GRACE_SECONDS` is now 0 and
  the anchor is gone: credentials without an entitlement need ONE verified
  token from a successful online `/entitlement` refresh; until then every
  operation raises `EntitlementError("setup_incomplete")` ("connect to the
  internet once to finish setup"). An upgrade installed while offline therefore
  waits for one connection.
- **A local skew kept a once-valid token fresh forever.** `server_now = hwm -
  skew` trusted the skew (or `received_at`) in `entitlement.json`; an edited
  skew, or a file holding only a token (skew then derived from "now" on every
  evaluation), moved server time back without bound. A skew read from the file
  may now express at most a one-hour clock lead (`MAX_SKEW_AHEAD_SECONDS`); a
  skew this process measured on its own successful refresh is used exactly as
  measured. A clock genuinely more than an hour ahead, in a new process while
  offline, sees its token expire early by the excess; online, the next refresh
  restores it.
- A stored `retry_after_until` further out than any server `Retry-After` could
  set (one day) is ignored, so an edited file cannot suppress refreshes.
- `sibyl_memory_client.testing.forbid_external_network` matched loopback by
  string PREFIX (`localhost.example.com` and `127.evil.test` passed). It now
  requires a loopback or unspecified IP literal or the name `localhost`, also
  refuses non-loopback `getaddrinfo` lookups and `socket.create_connection`,
  and records every refusal (`refused_connections`,
  `assert_no_external_attempts`): every conftest in the family fails a test
  that attempted a non-loopback connection, even one it caught.

### Added
- **Account gate on every memory operation.** `MemoryClient._track_op` calls
  `EntitlementGate.require(kind)` before the wrapped method. The decorator now
  covers every public read and write: `set_entity`, `get_entity`,
  `list_entities`, `delete_entity`, `set_state`, `get_state`, `write_event`,
  `read_events`, `set_reference`, `get_reference`, `archive_entity`, `search`,
  `search_entities`, `learner`, `learn`, `list_skill_proposals`,
  `accept_skill_proposal`, `reject_skill_proposal`, `lint`
  (`multi_record_search` and `refine_zero` inherit it through `search` /
  `list_entities`). `get_tenant`, `set_tenant`, `get_tier`, `storage`,
  `schema_version` and `free_tier_status` stay open. A coverage test fails if a
  public method that is not on the open list lacks the decorator.
- `_entitlement.py`: the SE1 entitlement (`SE1.<b64url payload>.<b64url
  Ed25519 sig>`, at most 4096 bytes). The signature over the ASCII bytes of
  `SE1.<payload_b64>` is verified against each pinned key BEFORE the payload
  JSON is parsed, and the payload's `kid` must name the key that verified.
  States `no_account` / `bootstrap` / `fresh` / `stale` / `locked`; binding to
  this computer (`sub` = account, `ten` = tenant or account, `dh` =
  sha256 of the trimmed, lowercased session token); bands `exp` and
  `exp + og` with a 300 s `nbf` tolerance; a clock high-water mark so a
  rolled-back clock cannot extend a grace window (a successful refresh resets
  it, so a corrected clock heals); an authoritative denial (401 signed out,
  403 tamper under review, 403 client_too_old, 404 account deleted) discards
  the token at once and is retried at most every 15 minutes; legacy
  credentials with no entitlement get one blocking refresh and NO offline
  grace (`setup_incomplete` until one check-in succeeds; see Fixed). `entitlement.json` lives
  beside the credentials file: mode 0600, symlink-refusing, bounded read,
  mkstemp + `os.replace`, an O_EXCL lock so several processes make one
  refresh call. The session bearer is only ever sent to https *.sibyllabs.org
  (or loopback). `SIBYL_API_BASE` is the only environment variable the module
  reads; there is no switch that disables the gate (source-guard tests).
- `_entitlement_keys.py`: the pinned public keys. The production key is
  pinned (kid `cb6fda3561b7ba39`, generated 2026-10-02, replacing the build
  placeholder `5dd0b6c80d97bae2`); `PLACEHOLDER_KIDS` is empty.
  `scripts/check_release_keys.py --src src --expect-kids cb6fda3561b7ba39`
  exits 0 (and still exits 1 against the placeholder). Release day: confirm
  `/api/plugin/health` `entitlement_public_keys` lists the same kid, then run
  the compat gate with it.
- `EntitlementError` (`sibyl_memory_client.EntitlementError`): `code` is the
  fine reason (`no_account`, `signed_out`, `expired_offline`,
  `setup_incomplete`, `under_review`,
  `account_deleted`, `invalid_entitlement`, `wrong_device`,
  `policy_read_only`, `policy_none`, `client_too_old`), the message is the
  plain-language copy with the one action, `recovery` and `account_url`.
- `MemoryClient(..., credentials_path=, entitlement_gate=)` and the same on
  `MemoryClient.local`. Construction never raises for entitlement reasons.
  `require_entitlement(op)` and `entitlement_notice()` (the offline-grace /
  email-nag line, at most once per process per 24 h per text).
- `sibyl_memory_client.testing`: `NullEntitlementGate` (constructor-injected
  only), `TestSigner`, `install_entitled_home`, `patch_trusted_keys`,
  `forbid_external_network` for the family's test suites.

### Changed
- `_effective_tier()` prefers a verified entitlement's tier over the tier
  cache and the credentials hint: an edited `tier` in credentials.json no
  longer unlocks the learner or the linter (the CORE-10 residual is closed).
  The `tier=` argument is only a hint: every operation needs a verified
  entitlement, whose tier wins.
- The cap gate takes the entitlement tier as its local hint and sends
  `entitlement` (body and `X-Sibyl-Entitlement`) on `/check-write` INSTEAD of
  `credentials_claim` / `credentials_signature`, so email and wallet are off
  that wire. An uncapped tier cache is honoured only while the entitlement
  says paid or this process just received an uncapped verdict (a forged
  `tier_cache.json` alone never unlocks). A server tier that differs from the
  entitlement's triggers a refresh.
- `/check-write` 403 `entitlement_invalid` and `client_too_old` get one-action
  copy (run `sibyl init`; `pip install -U ...`) and stay authoritative (free
  cap enforced, never fail-open).
- The heartbeat sends `User-Agent: sibyl-memory-client/<version>` (was
  versionless, so the server's version floor could not apply) and the
  device's entitlement as `X-Sibyl-Entitlement`, only with the bearer and only
  to the trusted host.
- New runtime dependency: `cryptography>=42` (Ed25519 verification;
  hermes-agent already pulls it).

### Compatibility
- Verified in a fresh venv with the five built wheels against hermes-agent
  0.19.0 (current on PyPI at build time).
- Cross-checked against the api's shared test vector
  (`tests/fixtures/entitlement-vector-1.json`, public test key
  `ea5ac758286ce1d3`): the token verifies and reproduces byte for byte.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Tier `pro` is recognized as a paid tier everywhere a tier name is consulted
  (`PAID_TIERS` in the cap check, `_PAID_ONLY_TIERS` feature gates,
  `TIER_SOFT_CAPS` in the linter). `pro` is now THE single upgraded tier:
  card purchases (Stripe), USDC purchases (x402), and $SIBYL staker
  qualification all resolve to it server-side. Legacy paid tier names
  (`sync`, `team`, `lifetime`, `stake`, `enterprise`) remain recognized for
  historical subscriptions.
- Dated regression tests pin the three tier surfaces to each other so a
  server-side tier name the client does not know can never silently demote
  a paying user again (`tests/test_pro_tier_2026_09_03.py`).

### Changed
- **First runtime dependency: `certifi>=2024.7.4`.** The SDK was deliberately
  zero-dependency; the macOS trust gap below cannot be closed from inside the
  stdlib, so certifi is the one exception. If certifi is somehow absent
  (running from a bare source tree), `_trust.https_context()` returns the
  stdlib default context unchanged, exactly the pre-0.8.1 behavior, never a
  crash.
- Package metadata now names the supported platforms: `Operating System ::
  POSIX :: Linux` and `Operating System :: MacOS`. Sibyl Memory runs on Linux,
  macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), and Windows through WSL2. Native Windows is
  not supported. Classifiers are informational; pip does not enforce them, and
  WSL2 installs look like Linux to pip, which is correct.

### Fixed
- Free-tier cap copy now says 5 MB everywhere (the cap itself has been
  5 MiB since 0.5.0; 0.8.0 shipped with two stale 2 MB strings).
- **`multi_record_search` ranked a full-match entity out of the results in any
  store with a journal.** The IDF corpus count read entities only, while the
  document frequency behind it came from `client.search`, which recalls over
  entities, state documents, reference documents and journal events. One entity
  plus forty journal events gave `df=41` against `corpus_n=1`, the IDF weight
  went negative, the score total flipped sign, and the record that matched the
  query in full dropped out of the top ten. `_corpus_count` now sums the same
  four tiers the search covers, and the IDF weight is clamped at zero so the
  entities-only fallback path (and any caller passing its own `corpus_n`) can
  never produce a negative weight either. Stores with large journals will see
  journal-only partial matches stop outranking full entity matches; that is the
  fix. Regression pinned in `tests/test_mrs_cross_tier_idf_2026_09_04.py`.
  Reported with a reproducing test by @web3xDev
  (Sibyl-Labs/Sibyl-Memory#27).
  Cost: the corpus probe is now four `COUNT(*)` per search instead of one. It
  touches no bodies, and it is the same shape of query it always was.
- **macOS framework-build Pythons could not verify api.sibyllabs.org, so tier
  verification degraded and heartbeats vanished.** The python.org "Framework"
  build of Python on macOS ships without a CA bundle wired into
  `ssl.create_default_context()` (users are told to run the bundled
  `Install Certificates.command`; many never do), so every stdlib-default
  HTTPS call fails with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` while the same URL opens
  fine in Safari and curl. On affected installs the check-write call raised
  `TierVerificationError` on every slow-path write (falling back to cache, or
  fail-open with no cache) and the fire-and-forget heartbeat silently
  swallowed the SSL error, so the account never accrued usage signal. Both
  transports now pass an explicit context from the new `_trust` module: it
  starts from `ssl.create_default_context()` (platform store, `SSL_CERT_FILE`
  and `SSL_CERT_DIR` overrides, full verification, all preserved) and
  additionally loads certifi's Mozilla CA bundle. Additive only: a store that
  already worked (Linux distro CAs, corporate roots) keeps working; an empty
  macOS framework store gains a real bundle. `check_hostname` and
  `verify_mode` are never touched, so verification is never weakened, and
  there is no opt-out that disables it.
  Reported by @keyurbodar (Sibyl-Labs/Sibyl-Memory#29); independent
  implementation.

## [0.8.0] "Lucid" - 2026-08-31

The multilingual search stack was rebuilt: the query-time rescue layers that four
evaluation cycles had accreted are gone, replaced by one versioned write-time
normalizer, and every zero result now names its own cause. This is a minor-version
release because the search shadow's stored rendering changed (every existing store
re-backfills on first open) and because the response of every search entry point
gained a carrier object.

**Scope, stated plainly.** This release improves the INDEX layer, and that is
where its measured wins are: inflected and non-spaced languages get word-boundary
clean stored text, so a term can match at a word start instead of only as a free
substring. It does NOT solve default-path natural-language recall. The first call
on the default path still answers 32 of 155 natural paraphrases. What changed is
that the other 123 now say why, and 99 of them are recoverable by a caller that
reads the verdict and runs the taught two-retry loop. The 29 negation-phrased
answerable questions still return nothing on the default path; they now report
`negation_abstain` or `abstained_on`, and `NEGATION_POLICY` is unchanged. Nothing
here should be read as a natural-language-recall fix.

### Changed (SQLite floor: measured, and now enforced)

The package carried two different SQLite floors, neither of them run: `shadow.py`
documented 3.34 as the version where the FTS5 `trigram` tokenizer appears, and
`storage.py`'s schema-failure recovery told the user to check for "3.38+ for
json_valid". Meanwhile the stage-2 trigger rewrite, which stages the rendering
through nested subqueries that read `new.` INSIDE a subquery, had only ever been
executed on 3.45.1.

- Verified against SQLite built from the amalgamation at **3.34.1** and **3.44.2**
  (FTS5 + JSON1) and statically linked into a scratch interpreter. The trigger
  shape parses and fires on all four tiers, the backfill path renders
  byte-identically to the trigger path, and the shadow rows are byte-identical to
  3.45.1's on the same DDL. The parser-ceiling constant `_STAGE_OPS` was tuned on
  3.45.1 only; it is inside the ceiling on 3.34.1 and 3.44.2 as well.
- One floor now, `shadow.SQLITE_MIN_VERSION = (3, 34, 0)`, and it is **enforced**:
  `assert_sqlite_supported()` runs at the top of `Storage._ensure_schema`, before
  the schema apply and therefore before any migration write, and raises
  `SchemaError` naming the minimum, the found version and the reason. Below the
  floor the old failure was "error in tokenizer constructor" from inside the v4
  migration, which named neither. The second, contradictory "3.38+" claim is
  deleted, and a test asserts no string in `storage.py` states a SQLite version.
- `shadow.SQLITE_FULL_FOLD_VERSION = (3, 45, 0)` is a FEATURE boundary, not a
  floor. Below 3.45 the shadow folds the non-decomposables in `FOLD_MAP`
  (l-stroke, sharp s, o-slash, ae, d-stroke, dotless i, oe, thorn, eth) but not
  decomposable diacritics, because that fold is the tokenizer's job and
  `remove_diacritics` reached `trigram` in 3.45. So `Belzyce` does not find
  `Bełżyce` on 3.34 through 3.44. The store opens, writes, migrates and searches;
  the primary porter-unicode61 index is unaffected.
- Measured on the suite, not asserted: 476 passed / 12 skipped on 3.34.1 and on
  3.44.2, 477 passed / 11 skipped on 3.45.1. The single extra skip is the
  `Belzyce` test, gated on the 3.45 boundary with the reason naming the version.
  A companion test with only a non-decomposable fold runs on every version, so
  the gate cannot become a place where the fold quietly stops being tested.

### Determinism

0.7.0, the released build, was **nondeterministic**: on the LongMemEval slice it
reproduces 87 of 100 questions across passes. The causes were two ordering bugs,
both fixed here.

- The shadow's final tie-break was the row's business key, and a journal row's key
  is a uuid4 minted at write time, so two tied journal rows swapped places between
  runs of identical code on journal-heavy stores. The tie-break is now the row
  text.
- The relaxed ladder used `sorted(set(...), key=len, reverse=True)`, a stable sort
  over a SET, so equal-length tokens came out in randomised string-hash order. The
  key is now `(-len(t), t)`.

This build reproduces 100 of 100, and the full battery is byte-identical across
`PYTHONHASHSEED` 0, 1, 12345 and 98765 on rows and on verdicts.

### Added

**The cause-carrying verdict contract** (branch `lang-core-verdict`,
2026-08-31). Four external evaluation cycles reduced to one defect: a zero result
that cannot explain itself. `multi_record_search` could return `[]` for five
structurally different reasons — an unsupported discriminating term, the negation
policy, three separate scoring gates, an empty store, an honest miss — and all
five reached the caller as the same four bytes.

- **`verdicts.py`, the ONE canonical cause vocabulary.** A closed enum
  (`VerdictCode`: `ok` / `abstained_on` / `negation_abstain` / `gated` /
  `empty_store` / `no_match`), the three gate names (`GateCause`:
  `coverage_floor` / `anchor_gate` / `prep_filter`), the `Verdict` envelope, and
  a plain-language `explain()` generated from the enum. Every package in the
  family imports these names; none re-declares one, and a contract test in each
  package asserts it. Re-declaration is how a surface drifts from the engine and
  starts reporting a cause the engine never emitted.
- **`SearchResults`, a `list` subclass carrying `.verdict`.** The verdict is part
  of the RETURN, not an optional kwarg, because the defect it closes was exactly
  that the only explanation channel was opt-in — and the MCP server never opted
  in. Every existing caller (`len`, iteration, indexing, `== []`, `json.dumps`,
  `isinstance(x, list)`) is byte-for-byte unaffected.
- **A single exit in `multi_record_search`.** Six `return` statements, all
  through one internal `_finish` that stamps a verdict. A bare `return []` is now
  a source-level contract violation, asserted by a test that reads the function's
  own source. The three verify gates each count their drops (per-gate counters
  plus the best coverage any candidate reached), so a `gated` zero can say which
  gate emptied it and how close the best row came.
- **`empty_store` is probed, never inferred** — a count across all four
  searchable tiers, taken only on the zero path, once per zero. `entities` alone
  would have lied about a store holding only journal or reference rows.
  `refine_zero(client, results)` is the one-probe upgrade a user-facing surface
  (CLI, MCP) applies to a bare `no_match`.
- **All three SDK search entry points stamp a verdict**: `search()`,
  `search_entities()` and `multi_record_search()`. The two primitives can only
  report `ok` / `no_match` (they carry no abstention and no relevance gate), and
  deliberately do NOT pay the empty-store probe — `multi_record` calls `search()`
  once per query token, and a COUNT per token would be a real per-query cost for
  an explanation only the outermost caller needs.

### Deprecated

- **`multi_record_search(..., diagnostics=<dict>)`.** Still populated, with
  identical keys and values on every exit that previously wrote it, plus an
  additive `verdict` key. It is also populated now on the three exits that
  previously wrote nothing at all, which is the only observable difference from
  the pre-contract build. Prefer `result.verdict`: an optional channel is one a
  caller can forget, and forgetting it is the whole defect.

### Unchanged (asserted, not assumed)

No gate, threshold, lexicon, ordering or early-return condition was touched. The
full multilingual battery (PL/EN at 300 and 1400 entities, UA/TR, the 155-query
paraphrase set, and the hermes provider paths) is **byte-identical to `ef98f5b`
on every quality field** — ordered row keys, recall, rank-1, noise counts and
every aggregate. This stage adds explanation, not behaviour.

Write-time normalization for the search shadow (branch `lang-core-normalize`,
2026-08-30). One versioned normalizer, `shadow.NORMALIZER_VERSION = 1`, replaces
the query-time rescue layers stripped below. It renders the stored text at WRITE
time and the query at READ time from the same code.

- **`normalize_py` / `normalize_select`** — the rendering: `fold` (unchanged)
  plus boundary normalization, every punctuation and whitespace character
  collapsed to a single space, plus one leading and one trailing pad. The stored
  shadow text is now word-boundary clean, so a term can be matched at a WORD
  START; previously a word inside a JSON body was usually preceded by `"` or `:`
  and only a free-floating substring match was possible. Injected at the four
  per-tier expressions `_entity_txt` / `_state_txt` / `_reference_txt` /
  `_journal_txt`, shared verbatim by the triggers and the backfill, so both write
  paths render byte-identically. The rendering is staged through nested
  subqueries because SQLite's trigger parser overflows at about 27 nested
  function calls and the chain needs 51.
- **`normalize_token` / `normalize_terms`** — the ending rule, recovered from the
  removed D2L block with its tuned parameters intact (min 5, drop 3, floor 5) and
  two new guards: never truncate a token carrying a digit, and never truncate a
  token from an unspaced script (Han, Kana, Hangul, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Myanmar,
  Tibetan), which is what protects the CJK tail matching the shadow exists for.
- **`shadow_search(..., normalize=True)`** — the normalized pass. One probe per
  content term, always, in a fixed order, with no early stop and no selectivity
  re-ordering; rows are then scored by `sum(len(term) / df(term))` over the terms
  they cover, and the top-scoring rows are returned, ordered by whole-word
  exactness, then word-start matches, then BM25. Terms the ending rule did not
  shorten carry no score: that single rule, and no stoplist, is what stops 'and'
  or 'gdzie' from scoring every row in the store.
- **Twin masking closed** (2026-08-07 Finding 2). A single-token query whose
  token the normalizer shortened consults the shadow even on a NON-empty strict
  head, and appends. This is deliberately narrower than the 0.7.0 F2
  unconditional append it replaces: it cannot fire on a multi-word query at all,
  and it cannot fire on a token the ending rule leaves alone.
- **Order change below an empty strict head.** The normalized shadow now runs
  BEFORE the relaxed variants. Both are rescues, but the shadow answers the whole
  query while the relaxed ladder's last resort answers one token of it. The
  relaxed ladder still runs, unchanged, whenever the shadow has nothing.
- **Two bug fixes found on the way.** A short non-ASCII token was a hard AND
  requirement on every shadow candidate, so an accented 2-char Polish function
  word ('są') silently zeroed the fallback; only unspaced scripts keep that
  status now. And the journal cap `max(1, limit // 4)` was applied per pass, so
  strict and shadow caps could stack; it is now enforced across the whole result.

### Changed

- `_SHADOW_MARKER` 4 -> 5. Marker 4 is the fold-only rendering, marker 5 is
  NORMALIZER_VERSION 1; PRAGMA user_version is the on-disk stamp, so every
  existing store drops, recreates and re-backfills its shadow on the next open.
- `apply_shadow_migration` DROPs the ten maintenance triggers before recreating
  them. `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS` alone would have left a pre-existing store
  running the OLD rendering in its triggers while the backfill wrote the new one.
- `normalize_terms` returns `(term, anchored, raw)` triples.

### Measured effect

Same battery, same 300-entity store, all figures from our own runs
(`lang-core-rebuild/results/normalized.json`, three-way table in `delta3.txt`):

- `client.search()`: Polish matched recall 16/16 (baseline 0.7.0 was 15/16,
  stripped 8/16), Polish natural 19/19 (19/19, 11/19), Polish noise rows 17
  (57, 25). English unchanged at 16/16 and 14/14 on every path.
- Default path (`multi_record_search` and MCP): Polish matched recall 16/16
  (15/16, 8/16), Polish natural 13/19 (13/19, 5/19), answerable Polish queries
  returning nothing 6 (6, 20).
- Injection battery zero rows on all three paths, no injection token with any
  corpus support.
- Storage: the normalized rendering REPLACES the folded one, no second copy. On
  the 300-entity fixture the shadow text grows by 600 characters (the two pad
  characters per row; the boundary substitution is 1:1 in length) and the DB
  shrinks by 4096 bytes, one page, because punctuation trigrams give way to a
  smaller space-trigram vocabulary. Entity writes cost about 20 percent more
  (3.79 ms vs 3.12 ms per write) and a 300-row backfill 29.8 ms vs 16.0 ms.

### Documentation (ratification pass 2026-08-31)

Verdict PROMOTE. Two corrections; no behaviour change in this commit.

- **Report corrections.** `46a3abf7` is 5 rows / 3 answer-bearing, not 10 / 3
  (a transcription error against this repository's own recorded results). The two
  residual LongMemEval suspects are reclassified from "clean non-losses" to real
  losses: `e982271f` drops the session recording which venue was recommended LAST
  and keeps only an interchangeable venue card that contains the gold string, and
  `gpt4_f420262c` drops the EARLIEST session on an earliest-to-latest ordering
  question. The stated root cause was also wrong for `e982271f`: raising the limit
  to 11, 12, 13 or 15 does not recover its row, so an N2 holdback would not close
  it and it needs a RANKING change, which is scoring work and is not excluded by
  the constraint against head overrides. `gpt4_f420262c` does close at limit 11
  via a holdback, which is excluded. Both are now recorded as known losses at
  limit 10, clean at limit 25, deferred with reasons. The English noise accounting
  gains the `N-en-11` line it previously omitted.
- **OPEN, reported not decided: the append budget bounds only the coverage-1
  class.** Rows covering two or more terms are unbounded, so boilerplate carrying
  TWO of the query's terms produces 19 appended rows where 0.7.0 produces none. A
  per-coverage-level budget was built and measured and is NOT shippable: it costs
  35 answer-bearing rows across 7 LongMemEval questions. The distributions
  overlap (a legitimate level needs 12 rows at 1 term, 9 at 2 and 7 at 4; the
  sweep has 30 at 3), so no monotone query-shape budget separates them and a
  tie-group bound fails identically. Behaviour is unchanged and pinned by
  `test_corroborated_class_is_NOT_bounded_open_finding`. Contained meanwhile by
  the preserved strict head, an untouched default path and the MCP byte budget.

Gates re-run on the unchanged code: LongMemEval suspects 2, coverage 152 against a
shipped envelope of 112 to 121, both recovered questions still recovered, 100 of
100 deterministic. Battery PL 16/16 and 18/19, EN noise 20, injection 6 / 0,
byte-identical across `PYTHONHASHSEED` 0/1/42/12345. Client suite 427 passed /
11 skipped.

### Changed (revision 5, LongMemEval retrieval parity 2026-08-31)

A replayed-ingest retrieval diagnostic over the 100-question LongMemEval parity
slice found this branch retrieving a strict SUBSET of released 0.7.0 on long
natural-language English queries: 9 of 100 questions lost answer-bearing context
and 2 lost it entirely. The cause was removing 0.7.0's F2 unconditional shadow
append wholesale. F2's diseases came from the append being UNGUARDED, not from the
append existing, so it is back with the guard in front of it.

- **The non-empty-head append is no longer single-token.** It fires for any query
  except a single token the ending rule left alone, always behind `decisive_only`.
  The strict head keeps its rows and its order; only the tail grows.
- **A relaxed head no longer blocks the append.** A stage-1 conjunction head used
  to return outright; on the Downtown Farmers Market question that head is one raw
  session and the row stating the figure was one guarded probe away.
- **Eligibility is coverage COUNT; the idf score only orders.** Letting the score
  filter collapsed a long question to one row: every candidate covered one of
  three terms and a CO2 fertiliser row matching the rare `curren` outscored every
  row matching `frien`.
- **Weakly-corroborated rows are budgeted on the append paths.** Rows covering two
  or more terms all stand; rows covering exactly one are admitted best-first up to
  the query's content-term count. Refusing them loses the row that states the
  answer; admitting them all appends nineteen stored notes to `complaint review
  deadline`. The zero-hit path keeps its strict argmax.
- **Determinism fix.** The shadow's final tie-break was the row's business key,
  and a journal row's key is a uuid4 minted at write time, so two tied journal
  rows swapped places between runs of identical code on journal-heavy stores. The
  tie-break is now the row text.

Measured. LongMemEval: changed-suspect questions 9 to 2, answer-bearing rows 107
to 152 against shipped's 114 to 119, both total-loss questions recovering their
gold rows, `L1` and the 1,573-entity recall sweep still identical, and 100 of 100
questions deterministic across three passes (shipped 0.7.0 manages 87). The two
remaining are cap-boundary effects at limit 10, clean at limit 25, neither a
recall loss; closing them needs the N2 holdback, which is a head override.
Battery: PL 16/16 matched and 18/19 natural unchanged, PL noise 33 to 42 against
0.7.0's 57; EN 16/16 and 25/25 unchanged, EN noise 6 to 20 against 0.7.0's 46,
every added row guarded; injection supported-class 6 on all three builds and 0 on
the default path. Client suite 425 passed / 11 skipped.

### Changed (revision 4, final re-verification 2026-08-30)

Two changes, both in `client.py`, 31 insertions against 35 deletions.

- **The saturation override is DELETED.** Two revisions carried an exception that
  discarded a last-resort head which filled the caller's limit, and an
  independent reviewer refuted both discriminators, each with a fresh case that
  lost 20 correct rows: saturation alone lost `quarterly reconciliation`, and
  saturation-plus-degraded lost `quarterly audits`. The ladder orders by raw
  token LENGTH, a rarity proxy and not a relevance one, so degrading onto a
  shorter token is no evidence that the token is wrong, and any third
  discriminator built on the ladder's arrival path would share the defect.
  Nothing overrides the head now: a saturated last-resort head is returned as-is,
  which is 0.5.0 semantics. Accepted cost, one query shape: `termin rozpatrzenia
  reklamacji` sweeps up the boilerplate phrase in every stored note and fills the
  cap with it, matching `lang-core-strip`. Baseline 0.7.0 is one row better there
  through the F2 append that stage 1 removed on purpose.
- **The relaxed ladder's tie-break is deterministic.** `sorted(set(...),
  key=len, reverse=True)` is a stable sort over a SET, so equal-length tokens
  came out in randomised string-hash order; the key is now `(-len(t), t)`. This
  was cosmetic while nothing read the order and became a non-deterministic ANSWER
  once revision 3's override did. Verified across 12 random seeds and three full
  battery runs at different `PYTHONHASHSEED` values, byte-identical on every row
  set. `N-pl-13` improved as a side effect and now matches baseline.

Battery, all three builds under `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`. `client.search()` Polish
16/16 matched, 18/19 natural, 33 noise rows (baseline 15/16, 19/19, 57; stripped
8/16, 10/19, 26); PL natural rank-1 16 against baseline 15. English unchanged at
16/16 and 25/25. Default path completely unaffected by this revision: PL 16/16,
13/19, six abstentions; EN noise 5, equal to stripped. Injection zero-support 0
everywhere, supported-token 6 on all three builds and 0 on the default path.
Client suite 418 passed / 11 skipped.

### Changed (revision 2, after independent adversarial review 2026-08-30)

The first cut of this work was reviewed independently and returned
PROMOTE-WITH-FIXES with 2 blockers, both English regressions the battery could not
see. Full disposition in `stage2-report.md` §10.

- **The shadow no longer runs before the relaxed ladder.** Reverted to the 0.5.0
  order. The ladder searches with FTS5 porter, which reaches `story` from
  `stories`; the shadow only does substring on a fixed-length truncation, and
  `stori` is not a substring of `story` but is one of `historic`. Running the
  shadow first therefore answered with an unrelated row and LOST the correct one,
  for -y/-ies plurals and for every digit-bearing identifier (never shortened, so
  never a shadow content term, while CORE-11 exists to give it last-resort
  recall). One narrow exception remains: a last-resort single-token head that
  fills the caller's entire limit is overridden by the shadow, because filling the
  cap from one token means that token matched indiscriminately. A last-resort head
  that does NOT saturate keeps its rows and its rank 1, and the shadow's rows are
  appended after it.
- **The single-token consult requires the raw token.** `shadow_search` gained
  `require_raw`, set only by the consult: an appended row must carry one of the
  query's tokens verbatim, not merely its stem. Without it the consult fired on
  most ordinary English nouns, because the ending rule truncates every 6-to-8
  character token to five characters; `contract` reached control, contrast,
  contribution, contrary and contralto, `df[contract]` went 1 to 7, and the
  deflated idf pushed a correct row under `multi_record`'s coverage floor and off
  the default path. `df[contract]` is now 2, equal to released 0.7.0.
- **`shadow._heal` stamps the marker**, and the migration fast path additionally
  samples one shadow row and requires the normalizer's pad. `_heal` is a second
  writer of the rendering, so an old client healing a new store used to leave the
  new marker standing over the old rendering, and the new client trusted its fast
  path forever. The marker constant moved to `shadow.py`, next to the rendering it
  stamps, and is now 6.
- **The boundary set is complete.** 18 typographic characters were missing,
  including the Polish quotation pair and NBSP, so a word wrapped in them had no
  word start and the exactness tie-break scored 0 for it. `_BOUNDARY_CHARS` is now
  49 entries, the chain 69 replacements, six staged subqueries.
- **The re-backfill raises `busy_timeout` to 120 s for its duration.** The forced
  re-migration is O(rows) under one write lock (measured elsewhere at 27 s for
  100k rows) and a concurrent open died at the 5 s default above roughly 25k rows.
  A mitigation, not a fix; it needs a release note.
- Docstring and annotation corrections: `normalize_py` no longer claims
  idempotence, `_content_terms` is annotated for the three-tuples it handles.

Battery re-measured on all three builds after extending it with the three English
shapes it was missing (-y/-ies plurals, identifier-plus-word, five-character
prefix families) and two injection queries whose tokens have corpus support: 88
queries, up from 75. `client.search()` Polish 16/16 matched and 19/19 natural with
15 noise rows (baseline 15/16, 19/19, 55; stripped 8/16, 10/19, 26). English
25/25 natural and 16/16 matched on every build; on the DEFAULT path English is
byte-identical to the stripped build. Client suite 407 passed / 11 skipped.

### Removed

Query-time multilingual rescue layers stripped out of `MemoryClient.search()`
(operator directive, branch `lang-core-strip`, 2026-08-30). Four external
evaluation cycles accreted these layers at QUERY time, each compensating for the
previous one's side effects. They are being removed so the replacement can be
built at WRITE time on a clean base. This is a deliberate, measured recall
regression in Polish, not a bug fix.

- **F2 unconditional shadow append.** The folded-trigram shadow no longer runs on
  every query with its hits appended after the head. It is once again a
  ZERO-HIT-ONLY fallback, exactly as in 0.5.0: reached only when the strict pass
  and every relaxed variant returned nothing. This restores the 0.5.0 behaviour
  the 2026-08-07 report filed as Finding 2 (a weak English primary hit again
  hides a same-fact row in another language).
- **D2L coverage-gated stem rescue, and its probe ladder in full.** Deleted:
  `_stem_token`, `_stem_truncated_query`, `_head_searchable_text`,
  `_uncovered_stem_tokens`, and the constants `_STEM_MIN_TOKEN`, `_STEM_DROP`,
  `_STEM_FLOOR`, `_GATE_ROW_BYTES`. Deleted from `search()`: the coverage gate,
  the fully-stemmed probe, the selectivity-ordered probe loop (N3) and its
  no-early-stop behaviour (N3').
- **N2 relaxed-single holdback and backfill.** Existed only to reserve cap
  headroom for the D2L rescue; with the rescue gone it has nothing to reserve for.

`search()` is now exactly: strict head, relaxed variants on zero, zero-hit shadow
fallback. Nothing else.

### Kept (explicitly not part of this removal)

- `shadow.py` in full: the trigram shadow table, its triggers, backfill and
  diacritic folding (`fold_py`). This is the 0.5.0 foundation and the intended
  delivery vehicle for the write-time replacement.
- `multi_record.py` in full: the abstention side is unchanged — N4 any-df
  function-word drop, N5 negation abstention, the `df == 0` content-shaped
  abstention, the anchor/coverage gates, and the N1' diagnostics channel.
- The MCP fence/scrub stack and every other search behaviour.

### Measured effect

In-house battery, 300-entity store, 32 matched PL/EN queries + 35 natural
questions + 8 injection-shaped queries, all figures from our own runs
(`lang-core-rebuild/results/`):

- Polish `client.search()` matched recall 15/16 to 8/16; natural battery
  19/19 to 11/19. English unchanged at 16/16 and 14/14 on every path.
- The DEFAULT path moved just as far as the SDK path (PL matched recall
  15/16 to 8/16, natural 13/19 to 5/19) even though none of its own layers were
  touched. `multi_record_search` computes `df[t]` and gathers Stage-1 candidates
  with `client.search(t)`, so removing the rescue drives PL tokens to `df == 0`,
  where the kept content-shaped abstention zeroes the whole query.
- Precision improved: English `client.search()` noise rows 39 to 0; Polish
  57 to 25. One query ('aktualizacja cennika hurtowego') went from 20 rows with
  19 noise rows to 0 rows, which is the N7 regression disappearing along with
  the ladder that caused it.
- The injection-shaped battery returns zero rows on all three paths before and
  after, unchanged.

### Tests

Suites that pinned the removed semantics are SKIPPED with the reason
`removed 2026-08-30 lang-core-strip (operator directive)`, not deleted, so the
behaviour they asserted stays on the record:
`test_covgate_stem_2026_08_12.py`, `test_probe_selectivity_2026_08_16.py` and
`test_capfill_rescue_2026_08_16.py` at module level; two tests in
`test_shadow_append_2026_08_12.py` individually. Client suite: 340 passed before,
327 passed / 13 skipped after, zero failures. mcp, hermes and langgraph suites
unchanged.

### Fixed (independent adversarial review, 2026-08-31)
- **`gated` could name a gate that did not fire.** The GATED decision keyed on
  `scored[:limit]` rather than on `scored`, so with `limit <= 0` a candidate that
  cleared every gate was removed by the SLICE and the verdict blamed a gate for
  it. Unreachable through MCP (`safe_limit` clamps to >= 1); reachable from any
  direct SDK call.
- **The empty-store probe re-counted `entities`.** It is now short-circuited by
  the `corpus_n` the function already takes for IDF weighting, so it costs
  nothing on any store with entities and only walks the other three tiers when
  `entities` is empty — the case where it is load-bearing.
- **Two structural guards did not hold.** The single-exit test was defeated by
  `return _finish(...) if False else []` and is now parsed rather than
  string-matched; the one-vocabulary test missed single-quoted literals and now
  derives its literal list from `VerdictCode` / `GateCause`; the gate-counter
  test now pairs each `continue` with a `gates.record()` naming a DISTINCT gate
  instead of counting both.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-22

Multi-language search, part 4 (Polish-language evaluation, closing out
what 0.6.1 left open). Independent adversarial re-verification of the 0.6.1
release (an external contributor) found the N-series only partly
closed the default-MCP-path defect class: N2/N3 held, but a nonzero-df
function word could still anchor/pollute scoring (N4), a dropped negation word
silently answered the opposite of the query (N5, newly discovered), and the
df=0 abstention rule itself remained unchanged with only its lexicon grown
(N1'). This release closes N4 and N5, and ships a diagnostics channel for N1'
after a coverage-ratio alternative was implemented and measured unsafe (see
Fixed below). `search()` and `multi_record_search()` output shapes are
backward-compatible except where a caller was relying on N5's prior (silently
wrong) negation behavior — see Changed. New optional `diagnostics` kwarg on
`multi_record_search` is additive; every existing caller is unaffected.

### Fixed

- **N4 — a nonzero-df function word could anchor the ranking and crowd out the
  genuine match.** N1 (0.6.1) dropped a function-shaped token only when it had
  zero corpus support. A function word that happened to have SOME support
  elsewhere by pure substring (`'our'` matching inside `'c-our-ier'`) was kept,
  and because it was rare (low df) it could become the anchor term and sit in
  the idf denominator, scoring a spurious match (`courier-pickups`) higher than
  the genuine one (`warehouse-*`, matching `'warehouses'`) — measured missing
  `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` by 0.005 in the reported case. A function-shaped token
  is now dropped at ANY df, not only df==0, provided at least one content
  token survives (an all-function query is left untouched, byte-identical to
  0.6.1). `'where are our warehouses'`: 1 wrong result → 3 correct results.
- **N3' — the D2L rescue ladder still stopped at the first appending probe
  when it shouldn't have.** N3 (0.6.1) ordered probes by selectivity but kept
  the original "stop after the first append" discipline. For a query naming
  TWO concepts that both have answers (`'reklamacji magazynie'`), stopping
  after the first discarded a row that had already been fetched and paid for.
  The ladder now continues while `len(out) < cap` instead of breaking at the
  first append; fan-out is unchanged (all probes are fetched up front).
- **Coverage computation no longer assumes every matched token survived the
  drop step.** `cov = sum(idf.get(t, 0.0) for t in e["m"]) / total` — a
  candidate that matched ONLY a since-dropped function/negation token now
  scores 0 coverage instead of raising `KeyError` or (pre-fix) riding that
  token's idf into relevance.

### Added

- **N5 — negation-word policy.** Dropping a negation word (`'not'`, `'nie'`,
  `'nicht'`/`'kein'`...) as a function word left the query answered as if it
  were never negated (`'contract not approved'` → the record saying it WAS
  approved). Full-text search has no negation handling either way, so this is
  a policy decision, not a quality regression: `NEGATION_POLICY` (module
  constant, default `"abstain"`) makes a dropped negation word abstain the
  query (`[]`) instead of silently answering the opposite. `"ignore"`
  preserves the pre-N5 behavior as an explicit opt-out. Verified against the
  full suite with zero regressions.
- **N1' diagnostics channel.** A coverage-ratio alternative to the df==0
  abstention rule ("abstain only when supported-token coverage falls below a
  fraction of the query") was implemented and measured, then rejected on
  evidence: the paraphrase class and the abstention class collide at
  identical coverage ratios with opposite required outcomes (e.g. 0.667 for
  both an answerable multi-word question and an unanswerable
  short-discriminator query) — `df` cannot distinguish an unsupported
  CONNECTIVE VERB from an unsupported DISCRIMINATOR without a signal this
  module does not have (morphology/POS). `DF0_ABSTAIN_POLICY` is recorded as
  a documented sentinel (`"any"`, the only supported value) rather than
  shipped as a second, unsafe code path. What ships instead: an optional
  `diagnostics: dict | None` kwarg on `multi_record_search`, populated with
  `abstained`, `abstained_on`, `dropped_function`, `negation_dropped`, and
  `coverage` — additive, zero extra searches, zero precision cost. `count: 0`
  stops being indistinguishable from "nothing is stored"; a caller reading
  `abstained_on` can retry `tiers="entity"` with the one word to drop instead.

### Changed

- Default runtime behavior for a query containing a negation word that gets
  dropped as a function word: previously answered with the record asserting
  the opposite (silently wrong); now abstains (`[]`) unless `NEGATION_POLICY`
  is explicitly set to `"ignore"`. This is the one behavior change in this
  release that isn't purely additive — flagged here per SemVer minor
  (real query results can change for negated inputs, everything else is
  either a precision improvement or additive).

### Provenance

An external contributor independently reproduced both the
2026-08-07 and 2026-08-13 Polish-language evaluation reports as pytest regression suites
against clean PyPI installs, confirmed F1/F2/F3/N2/N3 closed, and reproduced
N4/N1'/N3'/N5 live on 0.6.1 (black-box, freshly-spawned MCP process included).
He also flagged a packaging hazard closed in this release cycle (see mcp/
hermes CHANGELOGs): `sibyl-memory-mcp` and `sibyl-memory-hermes` floored on
`sibyl-memory-client>=0.5.0`, so an MCP- or Hermes-only `pip install -U` was a
silent no-op once `sibyl-memory-cli`'s tighter floor was the only thing
actually pulling a newer client. He built and emailed a working patch with a
339/343-passing test run; that attachment did not survive the Gmail-attachment
retrieval path intact (gzip CRC mismatch, confirmed corrupt against two
independent decode paths in the same session this shipped). The fix above is
SIBYL's independent reimplementation against his detailed written analysis,
verified against the scenarios he reproduced rather than his exact bytes.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-16

Multi-language search, part 3 (Polish-language evaluation, follow-up to
0.6.0). Three targeted recall fixes on the retrieve-then-verify + rescue path.
`search()` and `multi_record_search()` output shapes are unchanged and every
change is strictly append-only / additive-at-cap, so this stays a
backward-compatible release: no migration, no downstream (`mcp`/`hermes`/
`langgraph`/`cli`) code change required. Regression gate held: existing client
suite green; the SDK `client.search()` PL/EN twin battery stays **PL 16/16,
EN 16/16** at 32 / 300 / 3000 entities. The headline of this release is that the
agent-**default** MCP path (`memory_search` with `tiers` omitted →
`multi_record_search`) now reaches that same parity on natural question-shaped
queries: a faithful default-path battery (16 parallel PL + 16 EN facts, Polish
stored inflected and queried in a DIFFERENT inflection) moved **PL 9/16 → 16/16
and EN 15/16 → 16/16** — every prior miss was a zero-df function word the lexicon
did not recognise (N1 / Finding B), not a content-shaped abstention.

### Fixed

- **N1 — question-shaped queries abstained on the default (multi-record) path.**
  `multi_record_search` abstains (`return []`) the moment any significant term has
  zero corpus support, so a discriminating absence (`rejected`, an injection
  token) correctly collapses the query. But the module stoplist `_STOP` was 23
  English words with **no interrogatives**, so a zero-support *function* word
  (`kiedy`, `gdzie`, `jest`, `when`, `who`, `how`) survived tokenization and
  collapsed the *whole* query — the agent-default MCP path (`memory_search` with
  `tiers` omitted) and the Hermes `sibyl_search` rail both returned nothing for a
  natural question. The df=0 gate now classifies the zero-df token against a
  **curated function-word lexicon ONLY** (`_DF0_FUNCTION`: EN interrogatives /
  auxiliaries / modals / pronouns + declined PL copula/pronoun paradigms with
  their ASCII de-diacritic twins + compact DE/FR/ES/CZ sets): a listed
  **function-shaped** token is **dropped** (it carried no corpus signal by
  construction), while **anything not in the lexicon** (a content word of any
  length, a ticker / codename / brand code, a digit-bearing identifier, any
  non-ASCII content token) still **hard-abstains**. The drop happens before
  idf / min_df / anchor computation, so the coverage denominator excludes the
  dropped token (`kiedy jest inwentaryzacja` scores coverage 1.0 on
  `inwentaryzacja`) and the injection / `rejected` abstention contract is intact
  (`co0001 nonexistenttokenzzzq report` still returns `[]`).

  **Finding B (adversarial-panel expansion).** The first cut of `_DF0_FUNCTION`
  carried only a compact interrogative/copula set, so natural PL/other-language
  questions still zeroed on the default path when they used an inflected function
  form the lexicon missed (the fusional być paradigm is the worst offender:
  a future/present/past *person* the store never carries — `będą`, `jesteśmy`,
  `będę` — collapsed the whole query). The lexicon is now widened to the
  high-frequency function inventory: the **full być paradigm** (present / future /
  past / conditional, incl. ASCII de-diacritic twins), the **completed
  interrogative/relative family** (`kim`, `czym`, `jacy`, `skąd`, `dokąd`, the
  declined `który`/`jaki`/`czyj` forms), common **PL prepositions, conjunctions,
  particles, and pronouns/possessives**, plus the obvious missing high-frequency
  **EN / DE / FR / ES / CZ** function words. HARD RULE held throughout — every
  entry is a genuine function word safe to drop when absent; known content
  collisions were deliberately excluded (`bez`=lilac, `ten`/`nas`/`nią`, the
  number words `one`/`ten`, `mine`/`can`/`may`, DE `die`/`war`/`man`/`hat`, FR
  `car`/`par`/`son`/`ton`, ES `son`/`con`/`sin`/`era`, CZ `byt`). Faithful
  default-path battery (16 PL + 16 EN, question-shaped, tiers-omitted):
  **PL 9/16 → 16/16, EN 15/16 → 16/16**; SDK `client.search()` unchanged at
  **16/16 / 16/16**.

  Classification is **lexicon-only, by deliberate design.** An interim revision
  additionally dropped any `<=4`-char ASCII-alpha zero-df token; that length net
  was reverted before release because length is not a function-vs-content signal.
  It swept in exactly the short discriminators an entity/company store is queried
  by (`acme`, `acer`, `weth`, `usdc`, `aero`, `visa`, `ford`, `meta`, `ikea`,
  `sol`, 3-4-letter names) and, for an *absent* such term, dropped-then-collapsed
  the query into a cross-entity firehose (`acme report` returned 10 unrelated
  reports) instead of abstaining; it also let arbitrary short garbage tokens
  `continue` past the df=0 early-abort, reopening the CORE-6/MH-3 per-token fanout
  bound (`return []` on the first content-shaped absence is restored, so a 24
  short-garbage-token query issues one `client.search()`, not 24). The safe
  direction is preserved: an **unlisted** function word (any language, any length)
  falls through to hard-abstain — over-abstain, never over-recall. **Known limit:**
  because the classifier is a curated lexicon and Polish/German are fusional, this
  is an ongoing lexical-coverage burden, not a solved problem — inflected forms
  outside the lexicon (rare oblique cases, tense/person conjugations) still
  collapse a question to `[]`; widen `_DF0_FUNCTION` to cover them as they surface.
- **N2 — a cap-filling relaxed single-token head suppressed the F2/D2L rescue.**
  When strict AND missed and the relaxed *single-token* last resort filled the cap
  with rows sharing one common token, the `if len(out) < cap` guard skipped both
  the F2 shadow and the D2L stem rescue, and an inflected target that lost the
  FTS-rank lottery for a head slot never surfaced (19 junk rows FOUND the target,
  20 junk rows LOST it — exactly cap arithmetic at limit=20). `search()` now holds
  back a small tail reserve (`max(1, cap//4)`) of the relaxed single-token head so
  the rescue stages run, then **backfills** the held rows after the rescue: when
  the ladder rescues nothing the output is byte-identical to before; when it
  rescues K rows the result is truncated-head + K rescue rows + backfilled held
  rows, still exactly `cap`, still dedup-safe. **Strict-head invariant preserved:**
  the holdback can only fire when `_search_strict` returned `[]` (the sole path
  into the relaxed loop), so a non-empty strict head is never trimmed or
  reordered.
- **N3 — the stem-rescue ladder probed by length, not selectivity.** The D2L
  ladder ordered uncovered stems longest-first and stopped at the first that
  appended, so a saturated high-frequency stem (`aktualiza`, 20 rows) beat a
  discriminating one (`cenni`, 1 row incl. the target) purely because it was
  longer — the target was never probed. The ladder now pre-fetches the uncovered
  stems and orders them by **measured selectivity** (fewest hits = most
  discriminating), with stem length as the tie-break, then stops at the first
  probe that appends. The pinned stop-at-first-append discipline and length
  tie-break output on ties are unchanged
  (`test_covgate_stem::test_ladder_longest_first_and_stops` green verbatim); only
  *which* probe wins when hit counts differ.

  **Panel Finding A (regression fix, must-not-ship).** An interim cut bounded the
  fetch by slicing the probe SELECTION to the `_STEM_PROBE_MAX=8` **longest**
  uncovered stems before measuring selectivity. That truncated the candidate set:
  a query with >8 uncovered stems whose only reachable target sits on a stem past
  position 8 (in longest-first order) never probed it — a recall regression versus
  0.6.0, which probed **every** uncovered stem. The slice (and the constant) were
  removed: the ladder now fetches **all** uncovered stems, so no reachable target
  is dropped, and orders them by selectivity as above. Fan-out is bounded exactly
  as in 0.6.0 — by the uncovered-stem count, which equals the query's match-token
  count — with no NEW cost exposure: the default MCP path reaches `search()` with
  single-token queries (≤1 uncovered stem each), and `multi_record_search` bounds
  its own caller upstream via `_MAX_FANOUT_TOKENS`. Guarded by
  `test_probe_selectivity::test_no_truncation_beyond_probe_cap` (a 9-uncovered-stem
  query whose most-selective probe is the shortest stem — dropped by the old
  `[:8]` slice, surfaced by the fix).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-12

Multi-language search, part 2 (Polish-language evaluation). On the same
corpus, code, and store the Polish recall was 81% against English 100% — a gap
that is entirely linguistic, not a bug. Two search-path changes (F2 + D2L) close
it. Official harness (32-query PL/EN twin battery, LIMIT 10): **Polish recall
8/16 → 16/16, English recall stays 16/16**; a 6-query realistic PL multi-token
extension battery goes **4/6 → 6/6**. `search()` output shape is unchanged and
every change is strictly append-only, so this is a backward-compatible minor
release: no migration, no downstream (`mcp`/`hermes`/`langgraph`/`cli`) code
change required.

Also aligns stale `2 MB` free-tier-cap references (comments, docstrings,
README) to the current `5 MB` cap (raised in 0.5.0); no behavior change.

### Fixed

- **F2 — the folded-trigram shadow was suppressed by any non-empty primary hit.**
  `search()` fired the v0.5.0 shadow only on a total zero-hit (`if not hits:`),
  so a single weak/English strict hit hid same-fact rows in other languages —
  e.g. `search("packshot")` returned the English `packshots` row and skipped the
  Polish `packshoty` row; the failure worsens as the store fills. The shadow now
  runs **unconditionally** and its hits are **appended** after the primary
  (strict/relaxed) hits, deduped on the `(tier, category, key)` identity triple
  and capped at `limit`. **Append-only invariant:** the primary head is never
  reordered or dropped — the shadow can only extend the tail — so English recall
  and existing ranking cannot regress. (harness: Polish recall 8 → 9/16 from F2
  alone; the packshot class is fixed.)

### Added

- **D2L — coverage-gated stem rescue with a rescue ladder.** Fusional languages
  inflect by REPLACING endings (`reklamacj-a/-e/-i` share the stem `reklamac`),
  so porter token-equality (strict) and the trigram substring test (raw shadow)
  BOTH fail for an inflected query. D2L turns ending-replacement into the
  substring problem the shadow already solves, appended after the F2 head:
  - **Coverage gate.** Only query tokens whose stem is *not* already
    substring-covered by the assembled head trigger stem work. A query porter or
    the raw shadow already answered runs no stem probe at all — this is what
    keeps the pass off the English path at scale (stem probes measured 32/32 →
    7/32 per query battery-wide).
  - **Rescue ladder.** When some token is uncovered, the fully-stemmed query
    (all tokens stemmed, AND-ed) is tried first; if it appends nothing the
    uncovered stems are probed as single tokens, **longest-first, stopping at the
    first that appends**. This rescues realistic multi-token PL queries whose
    full-stemmed AND matches nothing (e.g. `status reklamacji` → the
    `reklamacja` row), the class an unconditional single stem pass hard-misses.
  - **Parameters:** `_STEM_MIN_TOKEN=5`, `_STEM_DROP=3`, `_STEM_FLOOR=5`, digit
    tokens exempt (`q3`/`v2`/`k8` stay exact). Crude fixed-length truncation is
    deliberate — there is no Polish stemmer in the stdlib, and *because* it is
    crude it survives stem-internal palatalization a rule-based stemmer would
    diverge on (`wysyłka`/`wysyłce` both keep the `wysył` prefix). `drop=3`
    covers the 2–3 char ending classes of Polish/Czech/Russian declension
    (`drop=2` misses `-ach` locatives such as `magazynach`); `floor=5` keeps
    stems long enough to avoid cross-lemma collisions at scale.
  - Applied ONLY in the append-only rescue path of `search()`, gated on
    coverage — never on the strict path — so the primary index and its ranking
    are untouched, and every probe goes through `_shadow_fallback` (errors
    contained to `[]`).

  **Measured trade-off (official 32-query battery vs F2-only):** mean precision
  0.980 → **0.9479**, precision@1 0.960 → **0.9688** (up), fp_total 1 → **4**.
  The two coverage-gated FPs D2L removes relative to an unconditional stem pass
  are exactly the avoidable class (same-stem noise appended to a query the head
  already answered). **Two documented residuals:**
  1. Shadow/stem appends are skipped once the head fills to `limit`, so the
     old zero-hit-suppression shape reappears exactly at limit-saturation —
     inherent to append-only + cap.
  2. Same-stem SIBLING rows are not appended when the queried concept already
     surfaced in the head (the coverage gate suppresses them). This is
     consistent with the battery's own false-positive convention (the same
     sibling-append event is scored as noise elsewhere in the battery); full
     sibling-vs-noise separation is semantic and requires F3.

### Roadmap (not in this release)

- **F3 — substring/trigram is structurally mismatched with fusional morphology.**
  Polish query-is-substring-of-stored held 0/7 vs English 7/7. The true fix is
  language-aware **lemmatization at index time** (a pluggable per-language
  analyzer writing lemmas into the shadow) plus relevance scoring to separate
  same-lemma siblings from same-stem noise. Out of scope here.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-06

Multi-language search. The default (linker) search path was effectively
Latin-ASCII-only: a 100-language write+query sweep passed **21/100**. This
release takes it to **100/100** (measured; deterministic dataset — one
native-script write+query probe per language). Absorbs PR #25 (0.4.20).

### Fixed

- **Non-ASCII and non-Latin queries silently returned zero results on the
  default (untiered) search path.** Reported via Discord as "Polish diacritics
  break full-text search" (`search("Bełżyce")` → 0 hits). The fault was never
  FTS5 (`porter unicode61` folds decomposable diacritics correctly and a direct
  `entities_fts MATCH` returns the rows); it was the query-side linker plus an
  index that cannot see inside an unbroken token. Five distinct mechanisms:
  - **M1 — ASCII-only linker regex.** `_significant_tokens` tokenized with
    `[A-Za-z0-9]+`, shattering any non-ASCII word into index-absent fragments
    (`Bełżyce → ['yce']`) or none at all (Cyrillic/CJK/Greek/Arabic → `[]`), and
    the linker abstains as soon as one token has df=0. (This is PR #25's fix.)
  - **M2 — ASCII-calibrated length filter.** The `len(t) > 2` floor dropped
    2-char CJK/Hangul words (the norm in those scripts) and Brahmic combining-mark
    fragments, emptying the token list → unconditional abstain. Now applied to the
    ASCII path ONLY; short non-ASCII tokens are kept.
  - **M3 — lowercase-before-split.** `query.lower()` ran before tokenization, and
    `'İstanbul'.lower()` emits `i` + combining U+0307, which then split. Now we
    split first and case-fold per token only when the fold is length-preserving.
  - **M4 — glued/single-token runs (index side).** `unicode61` indexes an
    unbroken letter run as ONE token, so `MATCH '北京'` never hits `北京烤鸭`; same
    shape for Thai fragment glue and Zulu/Bantu locative compounds. No query-side
    fix can reach inside a token — this needs substring matching.
  - **M5 — non-decomposable fold gap.** `ł ß ø æ đ ı œ þ ð` have no canonical
    decomposition, so no `remove_diacritics` setting folds them; `Belzyce` cannot
    find a stored `Bełżyce` without an explicit fold map on both sides.

  Staged, measured recovery on the 100-language harness:
  **21 (baseline) → 69 (PR #25 `\w+`) → 87 (script-aware linker, M1+M2+M3) →
  100 (folded-trigram shadow, M4+M5).**

### Added

- **Script-aware `multi_record._significant_tokens` (M1+M2+M3).** Splits before
  case-folding, keeps short non-ASCII tokens, and preserves **byte-identical
  ASCII behaviour** (the pre-0.5.0 stopword + `len>2` + lower token stream is
  unchanged). Supersedes PR #25's one-line `\w+` change.
- **Folded-trigram search shadow (`shadow.py`, schema v4; M4+M5).** A single
  standalone FTS5 `trigram` table (`search_shadow`) holding a FOLDED rendering of
  all searchable text across the four tiers (entity/state/reference/journal),
  maintained by DB-side triggers, consulted ONLY as a **zero-hit fallback** in
  `MemoryClient.search()`. Gives substring semantics (matches inside CJK/Thai/
  Bantu/compound tokens — and partial-word/typo'd-suffix queries in any language
  as a free side effect) plus an explicit fold map that closes the
  non-decomposable class in both directions (`Belzyce` ↔ `Bełżyce`).
  - **Strictly additive → benchmark-safe by construction.** The fallback fires
    only where today's answer is `[]`; a non-empty strict result is returned
    untouched, so ranking/recall of existing hits (English recall, LongMemEval)
    cannot regress. `prefix=True` searches are unaffected.
  - **No native dependency.** `trigram` is built into SQLite; the shadow keeps the
    plugin shipping pure-Python wheels. `remove_diacritics 1` is used on SQLite
    ≥ 3.45 and a bare `trigram` below it (runtime-selected; a DB moved across that
    boundary self-heals).
  - **Correct under old clients.** The triggers are DB-resident SQL, so a 0.4.x
    client writing to a migrated DB keeps the shadow in sync without knowing it
    exists; old clients simply never query it.

### Changed

- **Schema v3 → v4 migration** (`storage.py`): creates `search_shadow` + its
  triggers and backfills all four tiers, stamped in `PRAGMA user_version`
  (`_SHADOW_MARKER = 4`) by the same crash-atomic machinery as the FTS-rebuild
  marker — a crash anywhere rolls the whole transaction back and the next open
  retries. The fast path returns only when the shape is v3, the marker is ≥ 4,
  the shadow table is present, **and all 10 shadow triggers exist** (F1), so a
  dropped/corrupt shadow — including an out-of-band drop of a single maintenance
  trigger — is rebuilt on the next open. The shadow is derived state: base-table
  data is never touched and it is always rebuildable.
- PR #25's pinned `xfail` (`Belzyce` → `Bełżyce`) now passes as a normal test
  (its `strict=True` marker is removed).

### Hardening (post-review, 2026-08-06)

- **F1 — migration fast path requires the full trigger set, not just the table.**
  The v4 fast-path precondition previously checked only that the `search_shadow`
  TABLE existed. An out-of-band drop of any of the 10 maintenance triggers left
  the table present but silently un-maintained (writes stopped propagating to the
  shadow), risking a stale/false-positive fallback hit. The fast path now also
  requires the shadow trigger count to be exactly 10 (cheap `sqlite_master`
  lookup, `shadow.shadow_triggers_complete`); on mismatch it falls through to the
  idempotent `apply_shadow_migration`, which recreates every trigger and
  re-backfills — mirroring how the v3 FTS triggers self-heal on each open.
  Regression test drops one trigger out-of-band and asserts the count returns to
  10 and the shadow is consistent again.
- **F3 — one undecodable row no longer voids the fallback.** In
  `shadow.shadow_search`, the per-row `_shape_hit` join back to the base table is
  now wrapped so a single row with an undecodable JSON body (corrupt row, partial
  write, manual edit) is SKIPPED rather than raising out of the whole fallback and
  losing every other valid hit — consistent with the §4.2 "a broken shadow must
  never take down search" containment stance.

### Rollback

The shadow is additive and reversible. To restore exact v3 behaviour (base data
is never affected):

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS entities_ai_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS entities_au_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS entities_ad_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS state_documents_ai_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS state_documents_au_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS state_documents_ad_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS reference_documents_ai_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS reference_documents_au_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS reference_documents_ad_shadow;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS journal_events_ai_shadow;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS search_shadow;
PRAGMA user_version = 3;
```

### Notes / scope

- **Free-tier cap raised 2 MiB → 5 MiB (operator directive, spec §6):** the
  folded copy + trigram index roughly **doubles** the on-disk footprint (measured
  ~2.27× on an English-heavy corpus), which would have made free users reach the
  old 2 MiB cap roughly 2× sooner. Rather than ship that regression, the default
  free storage cap is raised to **5 MiB (5,242,880 bytes = `5 * 1024 * 1024`)** so
  a free user keeps roughly the same effective headroom they had before the shadow
  existed. The client constants `_capcheck.FREE_TIER_CAP_BYTES` and
  `lint.DEFAULT_SOFT_CAP_BYTES` / `TIER_SOFT_CAPS["free"]` now default to 5 MiB,
  and the user-facing cap messages say "5 MB". **Deploy-time parity (outside this
  repo):** the server `pricing.js` default `cap_free_bytes` and the server
  `sibyl_plugin.config.cap_free_bytes` must also be set to `5242880` so the SDK
  and server agree on the cap.
- **Honest scope of 100/100:** one native-script write+query probe per language.
  It does NOT claim full linguistic quality — no CJK/Thai word segmentation
  (substring, not semantic), no cross-script/romanization (`Beijing` will not find
  `北京`), no non-English stemming. Those remain for a future ICU/embedding tier.
- Impact on existing queries is nil by construction: English/ASCII queries take
  the identical pre-0.5.0 path and the fallback is never reached when the primary
  index returns anything.

## [0.4.19] - 2026-07-05

Super-patch: recovery + adjudication of the remaining Fable 10-lens audit
findings (`plugin-hardening-superpatch-plan-2026-07-05.md`), covering
`storage.py`, `client.py`, `learning.py`, `_capcheck.py`, and `_heartbeat.py`.
These fixes compose with the FREE-tier account-level cap aggregation shipped
in 0.4.18 rather than regressing it.

### Fixed
- **Per-thread SQLite connection registry leaked one fd per dead thread (Real
  #2).** `Storage` tracked opened connections in a plain list so `close()`
  could reap connections opened by other threads, but nothing pruned an
  entry once its owning thread exited — a long-lived `Storage` under Hermes
  (fresh thread per turn) accumulated one open connection per finished
  thread until the process hit `EMFILE`. The registry now holds
  `(weakref-to-owning-thread, conn)` pairs; every new registration sweeps
  and closes entries whose owning thread is dead or exited. A cached
  per-thread connection is also liveness-probed (`total_changes` read) on
  reuse, so a handle closed by another thread's `close()` call is detected
  and transparently reopened instead of raising.
- **FTS5 v2->v3 migration was not crash-atomic (Real #3).** The old migration
  ran as three separately-committed steps (drop / recreate / rebuild) with
  no marker; a crash between the drop and the rebuild committing left a
  v3-shaped but empty FTS index, and the shape check then read that as
  "already migrated" — search returned nothing forever. The rebuild now
  stamps a marker (`PRAGMA user_version = 3`) in the same transaction as
  the FTS rebuild, so the marker exists iff the rebuild committed; on open,
  a v3-shaped store whose marker is unset is rebuilt from the intact base
  tables before use. **Note:** this means every existing healthy database
  does a one-time, idempotent FTS rebuild on its first open under 0.4.19
  (the marker was never set by any prior version) — this is expected and
  safe, not a sign of corruption.
- **`TierCache.store()` used a fixed `<name>.tmp` name (Real #5).** Two
  concurrent cap checks — Hermes opens a fresh thread per turn, and
  multiple processes can share `~/.sibyl-memory` — could unlink each
  other's in-flight temp file and crash `os.replace` with a
  `FileNotFoundError`, failing the caller's memory write. `store()` now
  uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` for a unique 0600 temp name in the same
  directory, and a persist failure (disk full, permissions, a lost rename
  race) degrades to "skip caching" — logged, never raised into the
  caller's write path.
- **`accept_proposal`/`reject_proposal` had no in-transaction cap recheck
  or concurrent-review guard (Hardening #8).** Two callers could both pass
  the pre-transaction pending-status check and both commit an accept, and
  accepting a large proposal had no cap enforcement inside the write
  transaction that stages the new `reference_documents` row. Both methods
  now call the cap gate's local (no-network) `check_total_local` with the
  in-transaction logical size before committing, and the `UPDATE` is
  guarded with `AND status = 'pending'`; a `rowcount == 0` (already
  reviewed by a concurrent call) raises `ValidationError` and rolls back
  the whole transaction, including the staged reference-doc write. Skipped
  only for cap gates that don't implement `check_total_local` (advanced/
  estimate-only test doubles) — the production `CapGate` always does.
- **In-transaction CAP-2 recheck could fail open on a 0-byte size read
  (Hardening #16).** `_maybe_recheck_cap` used `storage.logical_size_bytes`
  directly, which returns 0 on any internal error; since this recheck only
  ever runs with a write already staged, a 0 is never a real post-write
  footprint — it means the measurement was unavailable, and passing it to
  `check_total_local(0)` would trivially clear the cap. A 0/failed read now
  falls back to the cap gate's own WAL-inclusive `db_size_fn` (the same
  account-level aggregate the pre-write check uses) before gating, so the
  cap is enforced instead of silently bypassed.
- **CAP-2 absolute-total check swapped shared instance state (Hardening
  #13).** `check_total` previously monkey-patched `self._db_size_fn` with a
  lambda and restored it in a `finally` — not thread-safe: two concurrent
  callers could observe each other's swapped size fn (a crossed total) or
  leave a patched fn behind if the restore was skipped. The absolute size
  is now threaded through as an explicit keyword argument, removing the
  shared mutable state entirely.
- **A failed `COMMIT` poisoned the persistent per-thread connection
  (Hardening #14).** Only the pre-commit path had rollback-on-error
  handling; a `COMMIT` failure itself (disk full, I/O error) left the
  connection mid-transaction, so the next write on that thread raised
  "cannot start a transaction within a transaction" for the rest of the
  session. `COMMIT` is now wrapped: on failure a guarded `ROLLBACK` returns
  the connection to autocommit (chained as `__context__`) and the original
  `COMMIT` error is re-raised.
- **Learner watermark could skip same-timestamp journal rows (Hardening
  #15).** `_last_watermark` cursored on `MAX(ts)`, so two events sharing a
  timestamp (or a backdated event) could be skipped on the next run. The
  learner now cursors on the monotonic journal `rowid`
  (`learning_runs.cursor_after_rowid`, added via an idempotent one-time
  `ALTER TABLE` on existing databases) with the timestamp kept only for
  readable logs; an explicit `since=` timestamp remains a valid escape
  hatch for a manual re-scan.
- **Search query string had no length ceiling (Hardening #9, subsumes
  duplicate finding R15).** `_sanitize_fts5_query` expands every token in
  the input into an ANDed, phrase-quoted term and MATCHes it across up to
  four FTS5 tiers; with no bound, a multi-megabyte / ~200k-token query
  became a ~200k-term MATCH executed four times — a CPU/memory DoS
  reachable from the client, MCP, and Hermes alike. Queries are now
  truncated to 4096 characters before any tokenization (best-effort
  truncate, not a raised error, since search is a read path); real
  natural-language queries are far under the ceiling and are never
  affected.
- **Co-occurrence learner had no bound on per-event tokens or tracked pairs
  (R13).** The co-occurrence detector built every 2-combination of an
  event's distinct tokens (O(tokens²) per event); a single pathological
  event could hold tens of thousands of unique strings and hang the run.
  `_extract_tokens` now caps distinct tokens per event at 64, and the
  detector caps total tracked pairs across a run at 100,000 (already-seen
  pairs keep accumulating hits; new pairs beyond the ceiling are dropped).
  Adjudicated low severity: the learner runs locally over the agent's own
  journal on a paid-tier feature, so the primary threat model is
  self-inflicted, not third-party.

### Security
- **Dict key names leaked verbatim to the Sibyl-routed summarizer prompt
  (Hardening #1).** `_redact_event_for_prompt`'s shape reducer preserved
  literal dict key names (`{"keys": sorted(...)}`) — content can hide in a
  key name as easily as in a value. Dict values are now reduced to a
  `{"key_count", "key_lens"}` shape descriptor (sorted lengths only, no
  literal text or ordering signal) via a shared `_key_shape` helper.
- **Hint redaction was a denylist, not an allowlist (Hardening #11).**
  `_redact_hints_for_prompt` only stripped four explicitly-named
  content-derived fields, so any future content-derived hint field would
  leak by default. Inverted to an allowlist: only known pure-shape/numeric
  fields (`hits`, `cadence_minutes`, `cov`, `confidence`) pass through
  as-is; `shared_keys` is shaped via `_key_shape` (Hardening #1, it carries
  key names); every other field is stubbed to a shape descriptor.
- **Usage heartbeat could leak the account bearer to a non-Sibyl host
  (Hardening #12).** The heartbeat URL is env-overridable
  (`SIBYL_MEMORY_HEARTBEAT_URL`); without a check, an injected override
  would still receive the `Authorization: Bearer` header. The bearer is
  now attached only when the resolved URL is `https` and its host is
  `sibyllabs.org` or a subdomain (checked via `urlparse().hostname`, not
  string matching, so a userinfo-spoofed URL like
  `https://api.sibyllabs.org@evil.com/` resolves to the real host and is
  rejected). Any other scheme/host still gets the heartbeat POST, just
  without the bearer.
- **`TierCache`'s symlink guard was dead code (Hardening #3).** `__init__`
  called `Path(path).expanduser().resolve()`, which follows a symlinked
  cache file before the later `is_symlink()` checks in `load()`/`store()`
  ever run, silently defeating the SEC-11 guard. Only the parent directory
  is resolved now; the cache file's final path component stays literal, so
  a symlinked cache path is detected and refused (never written through)
  while a relocated/containerized home is still canonicalized correctly.
- **Storage and cache directories could persist at a loose mode (Hardening
  #4).** `mkdir(mode=0o700)` is a no-op on an already-existing directory,
  so a pre-existing 0o755 `~/.sibyl-memory` or cache dir kept its umask-
  derived mode. Both `Storage.__init__` and `TierCache.__init__` now
  explicitly `chmod` the directory to `0o700` after `mkdir`, best-effort
  and guarded for chmod-less platforms.
- **WAL/SHM sidecar files had no symlink/hardlink guard (Hardening #10).**
  SQLite opens `<db>-wal`/`<db>-shm` at fixed paths beside the main file; a
  planted symlink there could redirect the write-ahead log (which holds
  committed rows before checkpoint) to an attacker-chosen file, and the
  perms-tightening chmod could retarget through it. `Storage` now rejects
  a symlinked or hardlinked sidecar before opening, and the perms-
  tightening pass uses `follow_symlinks=False` where the platform supports
  it (skipping entirely where it doesn't) so a sidecar planted after open
  is never chmod'd through.

### Changed
- Corrected the `_capcheck.py` module docstring to enumerate the real
  check-write payload (`account_id`, `session_token`, `current_size_bytes`,
  `proposed_delta_bytes`, and, when a signed claim is present,
  `credentials_signature` + `credentials_claim`); the prior "only
  (account_id, current_size_bytes, proposed_delta_bytes)" wording
  under-stated it (Contract PII, code half). The wire payload is unchanged;
  dropping the claim's `email`/`wallet` is the policy-gated follow-up.
- Packaging: added the `Repository` URL
  `https://github.com/Sibyl-Labs/Sibyl-Memory` to `[project.urls]`
  (previously omitted) (R27).

## [0.4.18] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- FREE-tier 2 MB cap now aggregates across every memory store the machine
  resolves, instead of being enforced per DB file (Discord report 2026-06-11:
  6.29 MB across 9 stores on one FREE account, each store individually under
  the cap). New `aggregate_db_size()` in `_capcheck.py` sums the SDK default
  store (`~/.sibyl-memory/memory.db`), the Hermes adapter store
  (`$HERMES_HOME/sibyl/memory.db`, `HERMES_HOME` defaulting to `~/.hermes`),
  every Hermes per-profile store (`$HERMES_HOME/sibyl/profiles/<p>/memory.db`),
  the `SIBYL_MEMORY_DB` override, and the active `db_path` — deduped by
  resolved path; missing/unreadable candidates contribute 0 and the walk
  never raises. Each candidate is sized WAL-inclusively via `db_size_bytes`
  (SQLite logical size, `page_count x page_size`), so the aggregate COMPOSES
  with CAP-1 (0.4.15) rather than regressing it — a plain per-file `st_size`
  sum would have under-counted data still sitting in a store's `-wal`
  journal. Free accounts already over the aggregate cap are blocked on their
  next write by design (the boundary check now sees the true account
  footprint); paid tiers are unaffected (uncapped). Regression tests cover
  both the sibling-store aggregation (two 1.5 MB stores -> 3 MB -> blocked,
  with the check-write payload reporting the aggregate) and the
  WAL-inclusive sizing (fails if the aggregate reverts to `st_size`); a new
  `tests/conftest.py` autouse fixture isolates HOME/USERPROFILE/HERMES_HOME
  and clears `SIBYL_MEMORY_DB` so the candidate walk can never leak a real
  local store into the suite.

## [0.4.17] - 2026-06-30

### Security
- Self-learning privacy contract enforced on the Sibyl-routed summarizer path
  (#14, B005). The `VeniceX402Summarizer` relays prompts through Sibyl Labs'
  inference proxy, so per the module contract "only the prompt summary leaves
  the device, never the underlying memory content." The prompt builder
  previously embedded full journal-event payloads (`events[:10]`) regardless of
  path. The Sibyl-routed path now redacts events to metadata only (keys /
  counts / timestamps — no raw content) before assembling the prompt. The BYOK
  path (`BYOKSummarizer`) is unchanged and keeps full fidelity: the user
  controls their own inference destination.
- Extended the same redaction to the `hints` dict on the Sibyl-routed path
  (multi-model audit follow-up, 2026-06-30). `hints` carried content-derived
  fields (`action_signature`/`pair`/`slug`/`title` — normalized first-N tokens
  of the raw `acted` string), which the initial #14 fix left serialized verbatim
  into the prompt. `_redact_hints_for_prompt` now reduces those fields to a shape
  stub on `redact=True`, while structural hints (`hits`, `cadence_minutes`,
  `cov`, `confidence`, `shared_keys`=key names) are preserved. The regression
  test was hardened to assert no `acted`-derived token survives in the prompt.

### Fixed
- Search fallback: short function words and contraction tails (`us`, `me`, `am`,
  `re`, `ll`, `ve`) are now excluded from the zero-hit single-token recovery
  step, so they can no longer trigger a spurious last-resort match now that the
  CORE-11 (0.4.15) `len>=2` floor admits short tokens. Strict search is
  unaffected (it keeps every token); this only tightens the relaxation step.
  Complements CORE-11's short-identifier recall (q3/v2/k8). Operator-directed,
  benchmark-validated (phrasing-invariance: in-contract recall held at 100%,
  zero new distractors).

### Hygiene
- `_heartbeat.py`: the telemetry `urlopen` call is now wrapped in a `with`
  context manager so the HTTP socket closes deterministically instead of
  waiting on GC (#15). Behavior unchanged.
- `client.validate_identifier`: the forbidden-control-character error message
  now reports the correct character index via `enumerate()` instead of
  `value.index(ch)`, which returned the first occurrence of the character
  rather than the position being scanned (#15). Message accuracy only;
  validation behavior unchanged.

## [0.4.15] - 2026-06-25

Pre-launch security audit hardening.

### Security
- Cap enforcement now counts the full footprint including the `-wal`/`-shm`
  sidecars (previously only the main DB file, so burst writes under-reported).
- The cap gates on the absolute resulting footprint, re-read inside the write
  transaction (CAP-2) rather than per-write estimate. The in-transaction recheck
  is LOCAL-ONLY (no network call under the write lock).
- Fail-open now fails CLOSED for a no-account / no-cache user (was: allowed up
  to 4x the cap when the verify endpoint was unreachable).
- A 401/403 from tier verification is treated as an authoritative "not entitled"
  and hard-denies; it is no longer classed as a retryable/transient code.
- `current_cap()` no longer honors a null-account "uncapped" cache (SEC-13).

### Fixed
- `json.loads` on every read path now raises a typed `StorageError` on a
  malformed stored row instead of a raw `JSONDecodeError`.
- Shared limit clamp on `list_entities`/`read_events`/`search`/`search_entities`
  (no unbounded or negative limits; `read_events(limit=-1)` is no longer
  unbounded).
- `set_tenant` validates the tenant id. `archive_entity` cap-check moved inside
  its transaction. Cross-thread connections are all closed in `close()`. A
  failing ROLLBACK no longer masks the original error. `multi_record` corpus
  count via `COUNT(*)` instead of a full-table scan. Short-identifier recall
  (q3/v2/k8) restored.

## [0.4.14] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Silent write loss under sustained load (CRITICAL; beta report 2026-06-17,
  report 3.1).** When tier verification was unreachable (e.g. the check-write
  endpoint returning a rate-limit-shaped 401 under a heavy write burst) and there
  was no cached tier, the write was rejected with `TierVerificationError` -- and a
  caller that ignored ok/error lost the write silently. The check-write transport
  now does a bounded retry with backoff on transient codes (401/408/425/429/5xx),
  and a no-cache write whose verification is unreachable now FAILS OPEN (allows the
  write) up to a 4x safety ceiling, logging a warning, instead of dropping data.
  Durability is preserved during outages; the server reconciles tier/cap on the
  next reachable check. Past the ceiling it hard-blocks. Test: `tests/test_capcheck.py`.

### Added

- **Paraphrase zero-hit search fallback (beta report 2026-06-14).** Natural-language
  queries miss under strict token-AND (+ Porter stem). `MemoryClient.search` now
  retries with relaxed variants (stopwords stripped, then rarest token) ONLY when
  the strict search returns nothing. Strictly additive: a non-empty strict result
  is returned untouched, and single-token / prefix queries (the `multi_record`
  path) never trigger it. Test: `tests/test_paraphrase_fallback_2026_06_19.py`.

- **Single-value size ceiling (red-team F5, 2026-06-17).** `_check_json` rejects a
  single serialized body over 1 MiB with a clear, recoverable error, so one
  oversized value can't flood agent context on recall/search.

- **Bounded learner scan (red-team F6, 2026-06-17).** `Learner._load_events` caps
  the per-run journal scan at 10k events (DoS backstop); the watermark advances so
  a large backlog drains across runs instead of spiking memory/CPU in one pass.

## [0.4.13] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Usage heartbeat (privacy-preserving).** Local-first memory operations never
  touch the network, so an account's request count under-reported real usage (a
  heavy user and a tire-kicker looked identical). The client now sends a
  debounced, fire-and-forget POST to `/api/plugin/heartbeat` carrying ONLY an
  aggregate operation COUNT -- no memory content, no query text, no PII beyond
  the `account_id` already held. Flushes every 15 ops or 10 min and once at
  process exit; no-op without an `account_id`; opt out with
  `SIBYL_MEMORY_TELEMETRY=0`. Never blocks or breaks a memory op; offline-safe.
  Closes the usage-visibility blind spot the beta reports surfaced
  (2026-06-14). Regression tests: `tests/test_heartbeat_2026_06_16.py` (7 cases).

### Documented

- **`forget`/archive is recoverable, not a hard delete.** Clarified that
  archiving moves an entity into `archived_entities` (recoverable, stored
  plaintext at rest) rather than destroying it; a hard-delete path is tracked
  separately. (big-patch PKG-11)

## [0.4.12] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **`set_reference(key, body)` raised StorageError on a dict/list body**
  (beta report, 2026-06-11). `body` now accepts a `str` or a
  JSON-serializable `dict`/`list`; mappings/sequences are coerced to canonical
  JSON (via the same `_check_json` guard used for metadata) before the INSERT.
  Any other type raises a typed `ValidationError` naming the `body` parameter
  instead of an opaque DB-layer failure. Regression test:
  `tests/test_set_reference_body_2026_06_11.py` (4 cases). (big-patch PKG-5)

## [0.4.11] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Cross-tenant search isolation regression test**
  (`tests/test_smoke.py::test_tenant_search_isolation`). Two tenants index
  near-identical "billing outage refund escalation ticket" vocabulary in the
  same database file; asserts `search_entities`, cross-tier `search()`, and
  `multi_record_search` each return only the calling tenant's rows (Discord
  2026-05-31 parallel-workflow report). Passes against current source: SQL
  `tenant_id` filtering holds on all three surfaces, so the reported sibling-
  case bleed is attributed to within-tenant topical ranking, addressed by the
  0.4.9 anchor-first resolver and 0.4.10 proximity re-rank. Tests only, no
  source change. (bugflow)

### Fixed

- **`search()` silently returned `[]` on unknown tier names.** Unknown values in
  `tiers` now raise `ValueError` (defense in depth behind the MCP-level
  whitelist; direct callers such as the Hermes provider inherit the fix).
  (bugflow)
- **Lint timestamp cutoffs were malformed and used deprecated
  `datetime.utcnow()`.** Python `%f` means microseconds (not SQLite's
  seconds-with-millis), so stale-entity and flagged-actor cutoffs rendered as
  `HH:MM:<microseconds>Z` with no seconds field, breaking the lexicographic
  comparison against stored `HH:MM:SS.sssZ` timestamps. Cutoffs now use
  `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` with an exactly aligned `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z`
  format. (bugflow)

## [0.4.10] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Multi-word search precision: "near-negative decoy" false positives** (Discord beta
  reports against v0.4.2 / v0.4.4; triaged from the 2026-06-06 bug intake).
  The AND-of-tokens default (v0.4.2+) gives full recall but lets short rows that contain
  the query tokens in an unrelated context out-rank the real answer under BM25, which
  rewards term density over proximity (reported precision ~73% at recall 100%).
  `search()` and `search_entities()` now re-rank multi-word results by match tightness
  before the limit is applied: contiguous query phrase (bucket 0) > all tokens within a
  small window (bucket 1) > scattered tokens (bucket 2), with the existing BM25 `rank` as
  the in-bucket tiebreaker. No hit is dropped, so **recall is unchanged**: only the order
  changes. Single-token and `prefix=True` queries keep plain BM25 order, so
  `multi_record_search` (the anchor-first resolver, which only issues single-token
  searches) is unaffected. New module helpers `_match_tokens` / `_normalize_text` /
  `_proximity_bucket` / `_min_cover_span`; regression suite
  `tests/test_proximity_rerank_2026_06_08.py` (9 tests). Verified: scattered-decoy
  precision@1 0/6 -> 6/6 on the reproduction corpus, 119/119 suite green.

  Residual (out of scope, by design): a decoy that contains the *exact query phrase* is a
  genuine lexical-semantic collision, the documented graph-native / GNN-tier case, not
  resolvable by keyword ranking.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **Multi-record search recall/precision regression at scale (anchor-first hybrid resolver).**
  `multi_record_search` used a corpus-fraction selectivity cutoff
  (`round(0.15 * corpus_n)`) calibrated on a 24-record reconstruction. Past ~150
  records the cutoff lost meaning: almost every term read as "selective," so
  cross-cluster records cleared the gate and polluted results (a tester
  Runs 16/17, ~0.36 recall at 50-100 companies). The resolver is now anchor-first:
  anchor terms are the rarest tokens, defined RELATIVE to the rarest query term
  (`df <= ANCHOR_BAND * min_df`, scale-invariant). The gate is a HYBRID: a
  candidate survives if it is in the anchor's cluster (matches an anchor term) OR
  clears the high-coverage bar `ANCHOR_HYBRID_HI` (genuinely relevant despite
  lacking the rare anchor). A pure strict filter killed cross-cluster pollution
  but over-dropped natural-language evidence; the hybrid keeps both. Abstention
  (zero-support term) and the terminal/prep gates are unchanged. Validated two
  ways: (a) synthetic 480-record workflow A/B — full recall, 0 cross-cluster
  pollution vs the old code's 1,920 polluting hits over 120 queries (matches
  tester Runs 24-29); (b) real-data LongMemEval retrieval diagnostic — per-question
  (oracle) retrieval is not regressed (NEW >= OLD, +3.4pts), and in a combined-
  store contamination stress NEW cuts cross-question pollution ~29% for a small
  recall trade. Regression guard: `tests/test_anchor_resolver_2026_06_06.py`.

- **Cross-tier rank comparability.** `search()` BM25 ranks are not on a common
  scale across FTS tables (`journal_events_fts` is contentless). Added a tier
  tiebreaker so content tiers (entity/state/reference) sort before journal at equal
  rank, layered on the existing 0.4.7 journal cap. (tester report)

### Added

- **`search_entities(category=...)`.** Optional exact-match category anchor on
  entity FTS, removing topical bleed across categories on multi-entity workloads
  (tester report). Backward compatible (defaults to all categories).

Sourced from beta Runs 24-29 + the bugflow batch dedup; this single
patch also supersedes ~20 already-fixed entries that had accumulated in the
bug-batch queue.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Prefix-mode FTS5 crash on all-operator queries.** `_sanitize_fts5_query(prefix=True)`
  routed tokens through `_drop_fts5_operator_tokens`, whose keep-all fallback
  (`return kept or tokens`) re-introduced raw operator keywords when every token was an
  operator. The prefix path then appended `*`, producing invalid FTS5 (`OR*`, `AND*`,
  `NOT*`) that crashed the SQLite FTS5 parser with a syntax error. Prefix mode now
  hard-drops operator keywords with no fallback and returns an empty match for an
  all-operator query (no safe expansion exists). Non-prefix phrase mode is unchanged
  (quoted phrases keep `"OR"` literal and valid). Reported via a beta stress suite
  (LEARNING-SEARCH-PREFIX-OPERATOR-MUTATIONS-STAY-LITERAL, 2026-06-01). Found + verified
  by bugflow; operator-approved.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-06-02

Bundled bug-fix release from beta/UserSignal reports (several beta testers), triaged + adversarially verified via bugflow.

### Security

- **Cap-enforcement bypass via a forged tier cache (SEC-13).** A local user could
  write `~/.sibyl-memory/tier_cache.json` with `account_id: null` and
  `cap_bytes: null`. For a pre-activation/free user (whose runtime `account_id`
  is also `None`), this matched the cache fast-path and returned "uncapped",
  letting an oversized write bypass the free-tier cap entirely offline. The
  uncapped fast-path now requires a real `account_id`; a null-account uncapped
  claim is distrusted and falls through to credentials-hint + server
  enforcement. A legitimately uncapped tier always carries an `account_id`.
- **Hardlink / symlink DB-path redirect across profiles (SEC-12).**
  `Storage.__init__` opened the SQLite DB after `Path.resolve()` (which follows
  symlinks) with no link guard, and `is_symlink()` is `False` for hardlinks. A
  symlinked db path or a hardlinked `memory.db` (`st_nlink > 1`) could redirect
  one profile's writes/reads into another profile's database at the SQLite
  layer. `__init__` now refuses a symlinked (final-component) or hardlinked DB
  file, raising `StorageError`. The check is on the db file only, not parent
  dirs, so symlinked / relocated home directories still work.

### Fixed

- **Search quality: journal entries drowned out real results.** On mixed-keyword
  queries, long journal entries (sharing common terms like "project",
  "research", "decision") dominated 50-80% of `search()` hits and buried
  entities / state / reference. The journal tier is now capped at one quarter of
  the global limit; the structured tiers keep the rest. The global rank-sort +
  limit still applies.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **A negative `limit` could broaden search instead of narrowing it.**
  `search()` and `search_entities()` passed `limit` straight into SQLite
  `LIMIT ?`, where `LIMIT -1` means unbounded, so `limit=-1` returned more
  rows rather than fewer. Both methods now clamp `limit` with `max(0, limit)`
  so an invalid negative limit can never broaden results.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-30

Adversarial remediation (beta stress-test suite): two findings + a review hardening.

### Fixed

- **FTS5 corruption containment (high).** A poisoned/desynced external-content FTS5 index threw an uncontained `StorageError` out of `search()` / `search_entities()`, crashing the caller. Search now self-heals the index (`'rebuild'` from the intact base table) and retries once; contains to `[]` if unhealable (e.g. contentless journal FTS). A single poisoned row can no longer crash a search. New `_fts_query` helper routes every FTS query site; `_heal_fts` performs the rebuild.
- **Primitive entity/state bodies rejected (contract).** `set_entity` / `set_state` declared `body: dict | list` but silently accepted JSON primitives, so a bare string/number persisted and broke downstream consumers that assume structured bodies. They now raise `ValidationError`. `reference_documents` free-text `str` bodies are unaffected.

### Changed

- Corruption containment keys on the exception *class*, not a message substring (corruption surfaces under varied messages: "vtable constructor failed", "database disk image is malformed", ...). `ProgrammingError` is re-raised so a genuine code/binding bug is never masked as empty results.

Regression coverage: `tests/test_stress_suite_2026_05_30.py` (7 tests). 96/96 suite green.

### Added (Terminal B — multi-record retrieval, tester Run15)

- **`multi_record.py` — `multi_record_search(client, query, ...)`.** Two-stage
  retrieve-then-verify search for workflow / linked-record queries (whose answer
  spans several related records). Per-token recall, then verify gates: abstain on
  zero-support terms, drop purely-preparatory records on terminal-state queries,
  require a rare/selective term match, IDF-coverage rank. Drop-in for a single
  `search()` call (same hit shape); `recall()` unchanged. Fixes the tester Run15
  multi-record-miss class (bench 10/10 vs 4/10 single-pass). Uses only the public
  `MemoryClient` surface. NOTE: gate constants are bench-tuned on a 24-record
  reconstruction, not yet generalized — validate at scale or gate behind a flag
  before publish.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-28

Beta-tester bug-report remediation (Discord beta reports, external test rounds 3/4).

### Fixed

- **FTS5 search: uppercase operator keywords poisoned recall.** A
  natural-language query containing `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` / `NEAR`
  (e.g. `"auth AND db"`, `"cache NEAR eviction"`) had each token
  phrase-quoted into a *required literal* term, so a matched row had to
  literally contain the word "AND"/"NEAR" — recall silently collapsed to
  ~0 hits. These keywords are now dropped during tokenization so the
  remaining terms AND together (the natural intent). A query that is
  *only* operator keywords keeps them as literals so searching for the
  word "and" still resolves. (`_drop_fts5_operator_tokens`.)

### Security

- **Identifier validation: path-traversal + metacharacter defense-in-depth**
  (external test #3 PARTIAL). `validate_identifier` now rejects the `..` traversal
  marker and the shell/redirection/quote metacharacters `< > | ; " \``. SQL
  was already parameterized; this guards downstream non-parameterized
  consumers (filesystem export, CLI display, logs). Apostrophe is
  deliberately allowed (legit in name-shaped keys). Bare `/` and `\` remain
  allowed per the v0.4.0 contract — rejecting raw separators is a contract
  change flagged for team decision.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Cross-tier timestamp precision mismatch.** `_utc_now_iso()` produced
  6-digit microsecond timestamps (`45.525358Z`) while every SQL DEFAULT
  used SQLite's 3-digit milliseconds (`45.525Z`). The width difference
  broke lexicographic sorting across tiers: `'Z'` (0x5A) > `'3'` (0x33)
  at position 24, so a journal event written 0.358 ms after an entity
  update would sort *before* it in any `ORDER BY ts` merge. Now truncated
  to 3-digit milliseconds to match SQLite output. Affects journal_events,
  revenue_events, error_events, learning_runs.completed_at, and
  skill_proposals.reviewed_at. Existing rows retain their original
  precision (cosmetic, sort-correct within their own tier). Reported by
  external tester smoke test on sibyl-memory-mcp 0.1.2.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-22

`_sanitize_fts5_query` default mode flipped from phrase-match to
AND-of-tokens. Pre-0.4.2, multi-word natural-language queries were wrapped
as FTS5 phrases: required exact word sequence: so
`client.search("H&M tops bought")` returned 0 hits even when the haystack
contained all three words. Surfaced by the LongMemEval 50-Q benchmark on
2026-05-22 as the dominant default-UX gap for Hermes-plugin users (every
natural-language query against the plugin's search returned 0 hits).

### Changed

- `_sanitize_fts5_query(raw, *, prefix=False, as_phrase=False)`: new
  default behaviour: tokenize input into alphanumeric + underscore tokens,
  wrap each as a single-term phrase, join with spaces. FTS5 treats
  space-joined terms as implicit AND, so every token must appear in the
  matched row (in any order). Callers that need phrase-match semantics
  must now pass `as_phrase=True` explicitly.
- Empty / all-symbol input still falls back to phrase-wrapping rather than
  returning an empty match string: preserves prior safety posture.

### Added

- `tests/test_search_default_mode.py`: 8 regression tests pinning the
  new default behaviour, including end-to-end multi-word recall against
  live SQLite + FTS5 storage.

### Migration

- Callers who relied on phrase-match (rare: would have needed exact
  word sequences in stored content): pass `as_phrase=True`.
- Most callers see strictly better recall on natural-language queries with
  no code change.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-19

Auth-redesign wave 1 step 15: forward-compat with the server's bearer
model. `/api/plugin/check-write` accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
headers in addition to the existing `session_token` body field. This
release sends both: body field for older servers, header for the new
protocol. The server populates device credentials at bind time,
so legacy `session_token`-as-bearer credentials still resolve.

### Changed

- `_capcheck.py:_default_check_write_fn` sends
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every check-write call.
  Token source priority: `payload["bearer_token"]` (server-issued in
  credentials.json schema_version >= 3) → `payload["session_token"]`
  (v1 backward compat). No behavior change against current production
  server. Companion: api-sibyllabs accepts both paths.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-18

External-tester remediation release. Independent third-party install
test against the v0.3.3 family surfaced one
blocker that broke `sibyl-memory-mcp` on PyPI plus four secondary findings.
This release lands the engine-side fixes. Companion releases:
`sibyl-memory-mcp` v0.1.2, `sibyl-memory-hermes` v0.3.2, `sibyl-memory-cli`
v0.1.3.

### Fixed

- **external-test BLOCKER**. `CapExceededError` and `TierVerificationError`
  relocated from `_capcheck.py` to `exceptions.py` so they are importable
  from the canonical `sibyl_memory_client.exceptions` submodule path. The
  v0.3.3 family had them defined and re-exported only at the top-level
  package; the `.exceptions` submodule path (which `sibyl-memory-mcp`
  imports from) raised `ImportError`. `_capcheck.py` now imports them back
  for full backwards compatibility with anyone reaching into the private
  module.
- **external-test RED**. `~/.sibyl-memory/memory.db` now chmod 0600 after the
  schema apply (was inheriting umask, typically 0644). WAL + SHM sidecar
  files also tightened to 0600 if present. Idempotent + non-fatal on
  chmod failure. Closes the file-perm gap the external tester observed on a multi-user
  / CI / shared-dev-box install.
- **external-test YELLOW**. `set_entity`, `set_state`, and `set_reference` now
  validate user-supplied identifiers (category, name, key) before write.
  Rejects: non-string, empty, control characters / null bytes, length
  > 1024. Raises `ValidationError` with a recovery hint. Read paths are
  unchanged: already-stored bad identifiers remain accessible so users
  can introspect and migrate. New module-level helper
  `validate_identifier(value, *, field_name)`.
- **external-test YELLOW**. `search()` and `search_entities()` no longer silently
  swallow `sqlite3.OperationalError` into empty results. The error is now
  classified by `_classify_fts5_error()`:
  - schema-missing (`"no such table"`) returns empty (defense against
    partial schema state on very old DBs);
  - FTS5 syntax error (`"fts5"`, `"malformed match"`, `"syntax error near"`,
    `"no such column"`) raises `ValidationError` with the original cause
    chained;
  - anything else raises `StorageError` with the original cause chained.

### Added

- `validate_identifier(value, *, field_name)`: public helper for
  validating user-supplied identifiers consistently across the SDK.
- `_classify_fts5_error(err)`: internal helper for translating FTS5
  `OperationalError` into the appropriate exception type.

### Notes

- The 2 MB free-tier cap (the external tester's product question) is NOT changed in this
  release. Operator decision to be made separately on whether to raise
  the cap or document the intent more explicitly.
- Existing 53/53 client tests pass unchanged. New tests covering the
  external-test fixes added in `tests/test_smoke.py`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-18

Audit-remediation release. v0.3.0 pre-ship audit (2026-05-18T05:05Z) surfaced
10 critical findings across four lanes; this release lands the engine-side
fixes. Companion releases: `sibyl-memory-hermes` v0.3.1, `sibyl-memory-cli`
v0.1.2, `sibyl-memory-mcp` v0.1.1.

### Added

- `MemoryClient.search(query, *, limit=20, prefix=False, tiers=None)` -
  cross-tier FTS5 search over entities + state + reference + journal. Each
  hit is tier-tagged with `{tier, key, category, body, snippet, rank, ts}`.
  Pass `tiers=("entity", "state")` to restrict scope. The marketing claim of
  "FTS5 across all tiers" is now actually true.
- FTS5 query sanitization: every user-supplied query is wrapped as a single
  quoted FTS5 phrase before MATCH. Column-filter syntax (`name:foo`,
  `rowid:*`, etc.) can no longer escape into the FTS5 parser. Empty queries
  short-circuit to empty result (no SQL error leak).
- `_sanitize_fts5_query(raw, *, prefix=False)` helper exposed for callers
  building their own FTS5 queries.

### Changed (schema v3 migration)

- **Schema bumped to v3.** All four searchable tiers (entities, state,
  reference, journal) now have FTS5 indexes:
  - entities_fts → external-content (was standalone with body duplication)
  - state_documents_fts → NEW, external-content
  - reference_documents_fts → external-content (was standalone, never
    exposed in the public SDK)
  - journal_events_fts → NEW, contentless, payload = evaluated || acted ||
    forward || extra concatenated
- v2 → v3 migration runs automatically on first open. Detects v2's
  standalone entities_fts shape, drops it and the old reference_documents_fts,
  recreates in external-content form, and rebuilds the FTS5 indexes from
  the existing base-table data. No application data lost. ~50ms per 10k
  entities on first open after upgrade; idempotent thereafter.
- FTS5 disk footprint reduced ~50% on body-dominated tenants (v2 stored
  the entity body twice; v3 stores it once in the base table).
- FTS5 update trigger pattern fixed: was O(N) DELETE-by-UNINDEXED-column;
  now O(log N) external-content delete-by-rowid.
- `search_entities()` updated to join via rowid (the external-content
  primary key) instead of entity_id.
- `search_entities()` now returns empty list on malformed FTS5 queries
  rather than raising. Previously `client.search_entities('"')` would
  surface a `sqlite3.OperationalError` wrapped as `StorageError` with the
  full db_path interpolated into the message.

### Security

- **SEC-2**. Atomic 0600-at-create for `TierCache.store`. Previously
  used `write_text(...)` then `os.chmod(..., 0o600)`, leaving a
  world-readable window between syscalls every cache write. Now opens with
  `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` and mode `0o600` set at creation
  time. No race window.
- **SEC-3**. FTS5 query sanitization on every MATCH path. Prevents
  FTS5 injection / DoS via malformed queries.
- **SEC-3**. `StorageError` messages no longer echo the absolute
  `db_path` or full SQLite error text. Original exception is chained via
  `from e` for debugging; user-visible message stays generic.
- **SEC-9**. `TierVerificationError` no longer echoes the server-side
  `error` body string in the user-visible message: strips to a generic
  "Retry shortly" pointer to avoid leaking internal server detail into
  user logs.
- **SEC-11**. `TierCache.load` refuses to follow symlinks. A
  low-privilege attacker who once had write to `~/.sibyl-memory` cannot
  redirect the cache to `/dev/null` or another file via symlink.

### Fixed

- **C2**. `__version__` no longer hardcoded. Now sourced from
  `importlib.metadata.version("sibyl-memory-client")` with the same
  `+source` fallback pattern as sibyl-memory-hermes v0.3.0. The wheel and
  the in-Python `__version__` can no longer drift (v0.3.2 published with
  `__init__.py` saying "0.3.1").
- HTTP User-Agent in `_default_check_write_fn` now built from
  `__version__` instead of hardcoded `"sibyl-memory-client/0.3.0"`. Server
  telemetry will accurately reflect the installed version.
- `from e` chaining added to `_default_check_write_fn`'s `HTTPError` and
  `URLError`/`TimeoutError`/`OSError` handlers so the original cause is
  preserved through `TierVerificationError`.

### Hygiene

- Dropped unused `Iterable` and `ConflictError` imports from `client.py`
  (DC1/DC2). Both remain in `__all__` via re-export.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-16

Audit-remediation release. Companion to api-sibyllabs payment-rail fixes
and the post-audit shipping pass. Closes T1-3, T1-4, T2-3 from the
2026-05-16 audit pass (full report: `memory/research/` + email
msg_id 19e33139dfc3e4d4).

### Changed

- **T1-3. `archive_entity` now goes through CapGate**. The audit found
  that `MemoryClient.archive_entity` bypassed the cap check, letting a
  free user at 1.9 MB archive their largest entities (body copied into
  archived_entities, doubling footprint) to keep writing past 2 MB. The
  method now reads the entity body first to size the proposed insert
  (`body + name + category + reason + 200B overhead`), then calls
  `self._cap_gate.check(proposed_delta_bytes=delta)` before the write
  transaction. NotFoundError still raised before any cap-gate side effect.
- **T1-3. `Learner.accept_proposal` now accepts an optional `cap_gate`**.
  `Learner.__init__` gains a `cap_gate: Any = None` parameter. When
  non-None, `accept_proposal` calls `cap_gate.check(proposed_delta_bytes=...)`
  before inserting the `reference_documents` row (skill body can be
  kilobytes). The convenience entry `MemoryClient.learner()` threads
  the client's CapGate through automatically. Direct-import callers can
  override `cap_gate=None` explicitly for tests.
- **T2-3. `_default_check_write_fn` no longer forges fake decisions on
  HTTP error**. Previously a transient 502 response synthesized
  `{ok: False, tier: "free"}` and the caller cached it as authoritative,
  locking a paid user out for up to 7 days. Now raises
  `TierVerificationError` on any HTTP error: the offline-grace path in
  `_refresh_and_check` decides whether to honor a recent cache or hard-cap.
- **T1-4. TierCacheEntry gains `server_expires_at` + `cache_token` fields**.
  `server_expires_at` is the server-supplied subscription expiry parsed
  from the `expires_at` field on the `/check-write` response. The cache
  is now honored only while `now < min(checked_at + grace_seconds,
  server_expires_at)`, which prevents the multi-grace-period attack
  where a user blackholes the network to keep using their cached paid
  tier past actual subscription expiry. Authoritative end-of-validity
  comes from the server's record, not from a refresh-able local timer.
  `cache_token` stores the credentials.signature as a defense-in-depth
  link between cache and credentials identity (sent on subsequent
  cap-checks for tamper telemetry).
- **TierCache.load/store round-trip the new fields**. Backwards
  compatible with v0.3.1 cache files (missing fields default to None).

### Schema

- TierCache file schema bumped (implicitly v2). v1 caches load fine
  with `server_expires_at=None` and `cache_token=None`; next successful
  `/check-write` upgrades them.

### Tests

- 53/53 unchanged, all green. The cap-gate addition in `archive_entity`
  fires under the default 2 MB cap on test data well below that
  threshold: no test changes needed.

### Notes for downstream

- `sibyl-memory-hermes` v0.2.2 ships in lockstep (narrows `recall()`
  exception handling to `NotFoundError` only, T2-2 fix). Earlier
  hermes versions still work; the bug they had was over-aggressive
  exception swallowing, harmless to the cap-gate plumbing.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-16

Tamper-evidence release. Companion to api-sibyllabs HMAC signing.

### Added

- `MemoryClient.__init__` and `MemoryClient.local()` accept two new
  optional kwargs: `credentials_claim` (dict of the canonical signed
  fields) and `credentials_signature` (hex HMAC). Both default to None
  for backwards compatibility with unsigned v0.3.0 credentials.
- `CapGate` accepts the same two kwargs and, when both are present,
  attaches them to every `/check-write` POST body. The server uses
  them to verify the signature and log `credentials_tamper_suspected`
  telemetry on mismatch. The cap-gate decision itself is unaffected -
  authoritative tier always comes from the database via
  `effectiveAccess`.

### Schema

- Credentials JSON schema v2 (server-issued 2026-05-16+): adds
  `signature` (HMAC-SHA256 hex, 64 chars) and `signed_at` (ISO ts).
  Old schema v1 credentials still load and work; the client just
  sends an unsigned request and the server skips the tamper check.

### Tests

- 53/53 unchanged, all green. The signing path is purely additive.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-15

Hard-cap enforcement release. Operator directive 2026-05-15: "how do
we hard-limit free users to the 2Mb size? and ensure they can't
circumvent this" → Level 1 (hard write cap) + Level 2 (signed
credentials.json, deferred) + server-authoritative tier check at the
boundary. Locked in: 7-day grace cache, hard cap on by default.

### Added

- **`_capcheck.py` module** with the cap-enforcement primitives:
  - `CapGate.check(proposed_delta_bytes)`: three fast paths plus one
    slow server-refresh path. Most writes never phone home. The slow
    path only fires when (a) a free-tier user is about to push past
    2 MB or (b) the local tier cache has expired.
  - `TierCache`: file-backed at `~/.sibyl-memory/tier_cache.json`,
    mode 0600, atomic write, JSON shape `{ account_id, tier,
    checked_at, cap_bytes }`. Honored as fresh for 7 days; honored
    for an extended 14-day grace if the user is offline.
  - `CapExceededError` (code `CAP_EXCEEDED`): carries `upgrade_url`.
  - `TierVerificationError`: raised only when the user is at the cap,
    offline, AND has no valid grace cache. Distinct from CAP_EXCEEDED
    so callers can route the two error states differently.
  - `_default_check_write_fn`: pure stdlib urllib transport. The
    default endpoint is `https://api.sibyllabs.org/api/plugin/check-write`.
    Replaceable for tests via the `check_fn` constructor kwarg.
  - Constants `FREE_TIER_CAP_BYTES = 2 * 1024 * 1024` and
    `GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60`.

- **`MemoryClient` cap wiring** (additive, non-breaking):
  - `__init__` and `local()` accept `account_id`, `session_token`,
    `tier`, and an optional `cap_gate` override.
  - Every write path (`set_entity`, `write_event`, `set_state`,
    `set_reference`) calls `self._cap_gate.check(proposed_delta_bytes=...)`
    with a JSON-byte-length estimate. Reads are never gated.
  - Pre-activation users (no `account_id`) get a strict local 2 MB cap
    with no server check possible: by design.

### Tests

- 13 new tests in `tests/test_capcheck.py` covering: under-cap (no
  server call), at-cap server says no, server upgrades a stale-cached
  user, paid-cache short-circuits server, stale paid cache triggers
  refresh, offline-at-cap with grace cache passes, offline-at-cap
  with no cache raises, pre-activation under/at cap, e2e MemoryClient
  free/paid, cache file mode is 0600, `invalidate_cache()` works.
  Full suite 53/53 green.

### Notes for downstream

- `sibyl-memory-hermes` v0.2.0 plumbs `account_id` and `session_token`
  through to the client. Earlier hermes versions still work but
  pre-activation users hit the strict local 2 MB cap.
- The Level 2 HMAC-signed `credentials.json` design is in
  `memory/research/2026-05-15-hard-cap-enforcement.md` (deferred until
  `PLUGIN_CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_KEY` is provisioned in Doppler/Vercel).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-15

Self-learning + memory-linting release. Operator directive 2026-05-15:
"add a self-learning cron + function to the memory deployment so the
memory learns and creates skills from things in the session just as you
do. could we also do memory linter?"

### Schema

- **v2 migration**: adds two tables. Idempotent. v1 databases auto-upgrade on next open.
  - `skill_proposals`: review queue for detected skills. Columns: id, tenant_id, created_at, pattern_kind, proposed_slug, proposed_title, proposed_body, evidence (JSON), confidence (REAL 0..1), summarizer, status (pending/accepted/rejected/superseded), reviewed_at, review_note, accepted_doc_key. UNIQUE indexes on (tenant_id, status, created_at) and (tenant_id, proposed_slug).
  - `learning_runs`: watermark log so detectors don't rescan ground they covered. Columns: id, tenant_id, started_at, completed_at, summarizer, events_scanned, proposals_made, cursor_after_ts, notes.

### Added

- **`learning.py` module** with the full self-learning loop:
  - `Learner` class: scans journal_events since last watermark, runs four pattern detectors, dedupes by slug, persists top-N proposals.
  - Four deterministic detectors: `repeated_action`, `structural_similarity`, `co_occurrence`, `temporal_routine`.
  - Three pluggable summarizer backends (per operator design directive 2026-05-15):
    - `LocalDeterministicSummarizer` (free tier default): pure SQL + Python templates, zero network.
    - `BYOKSummarizer` (paid tier opt-in): user supplies their own inference callable, SDK never holds the key.
    - `VeniceX402Summarizer` (paid tier hosted). Venice-routed via x402 against the user's pre-funded plugin balance. Endpoint design at `memory/research/2026-05-15-self-learning-design.md`.
  - Review queue API: `list_proposals`, `get_proposal`, `accept_proposal` (writes `reference_documents` row under `skill/<slug>` key with provenance metadata), `reject_proposal`.
  - Both LLM-backed summarizers gracefully fall back to local-deterministic output when the inference callable raises.

- **`lint.py` module**: local memory linter mirroring `scripts/memory-lint.mjs`:
  - `Linter` class with 9 checks across three severity tiers (critical / warning / info): schema-version, invalid-json-entity, invalid-json-state, invalid-json-journal, duplicate-entity, empty-reference, stale-entity, journal-without-acts, db-soft-cap, fts-rowcount-mismatch, flagged-actors-fresh.
  - `LintReport` dataclass with `to_dict()` (JSON-serializable) + `to_ascii()` (single-block boxed report for CLI).
  - Tunable thresholds: `soft_cap_bytes` (default 10 MB per operator decision), `stale_days` (default 90), `flag_recency_days` (default 30).

- **`MemoryClient` API surface (additive)**:
  - `client.learner(**kwargs)`: construct a tenant-bound Learner.
  - `client.learn()`: convenience: one-shot Learner.run() returning a LearningRunReport.
  - `client.list_skill_proposals(status='pending', limit=50)`.
  - `client.accept_skill_proposal(id, note=None)`.
  - `client.reject_skill_proposal(id, note=None)`.
  - `client.lint(**kwargs)`: returns a LintReport.

- **Public exports** (`__init__.py`): added `Learner`, `SkillProposal`, `LearningRunReport`, `Summarizer`, `LocalDeterministicSummarizer`, `BYOKSummarizer`, `VeniceX402Summarizer`, `Linter`, `LintReport`, `Finding`.

### Tests

- 22 new tests across two files:
  - `tests/test_learning.py`: 12 tests: schema migration v2, no-event runs, repeated-action detection, watermark dedup, structural-similarity detection, accept/reject lifecycle, BYOK invocation, Venice/x402 fallback on failure, multi-tenant isolation.
  - `tests/test_lint.py`: 10 tests: clean-DB baseline, duplicate-entity, empty-reference, stale-entity, journal-without-acts, soft-cap, ASCII report rendering, dict serialization, severity buckets, multi-tenant isolation.
- Total package coverage: 10 (existing smoke) + 12 (learning) + 10 (lint) = **32 tests, all green**.

### Compatibility

- v0.1.0 databases auto-upgrade to v2 on first open via existing idempotent `_ensure_schema()` path: no manual migration needed.
- `sibyl-memory-hermes` v0.1.0 is binary-compatible with v0.2.0 of this SDK (provider surface unchanged). Hermes-provider tests updated to expect schema_version=2.
- Local-first promise unchanged: free tier remains zero-network. BYOK / Venice routes are paid-tier opt-in only and the CLI gate enforces tier checks upstream.

### Notes for CLI integration (sibyl-labs-cli, next)

The CLI package will expose:
- `sibyl learn` → runs `client.learn()`.
- `sibyl learn review` → interactive walk of `client.list_skill_proposals()` with y/n/edit prompts.
- `sibyl lint` → runs `client.lint()`, prints `to_ascii()`, exits non-zero if `critical_count > 0`.
- Optional cron install during `sibyl init` (Linux/macOS cron, Windows Task Scheduler) for daily learn + lint.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-15

Initial release.

- SQLite + FTS5 port of the canonical `sibyl_memory.*` Postgres schema (10 base tables + 2 FTS5 virtuals + version table).
