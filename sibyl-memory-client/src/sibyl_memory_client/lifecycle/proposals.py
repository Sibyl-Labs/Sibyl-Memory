"""Skill proposals on Pro (R1, plan section 3 with the four existing detectors;
operator D7).

* ``run_learner``: the local-deterministic learner, run by the Pro process-start
  thread (MCP server, Hermes adapter) and at Hermes shutdown. Only when
  ``automation_allowed`` (verified paid entitlement); inside ``suppressed()``
  (its writes are the plugin's, not the person's); no network (the
  local-deterministic summarizer is the only one this release reaches); never
  inside a Claude Code hook.
* ``read_relevant``: the proposals worth naming, read-only from ``memory.db``
  (``mode=ro``, no gate, no network), so a hook may call it.
* ``skill_prompt``: the throttle (once per session, not within 24 h of the last
  skill prompt) around ``reminders.skills_line``.

Relevant (plan 3.1 / 3.5, deterministic): ``status = pending``, confidence at
least 0.6, at least 3 evidence events, at least 2 of them in the last 7 days,
at least one newer than the start of the person's most recent session (the
pattern recurred in the last session), evidence from at least two sessions
(two events at least 30 minutes apart; waived for ``tool_sequence``, R2),
kind not muted. Nothing is created
without an explicit accept; the free tier sees none of it.
