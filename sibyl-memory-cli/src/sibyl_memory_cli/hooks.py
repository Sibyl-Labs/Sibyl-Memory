"""`sibyl hook <event>`: the Claude Code hooks (spec plugin-save-debloat 5.2).

Installed by `sibyl setup` into ~/.claude/settings.json; not for manual use.
Each call reads the hook JSON from stdin (bounded), always exits 0, prints at
most one JSON object on stdout, and logs one short line (event and outcome,
never content) to ~/.sibyl-memory/lifecycle.log. A failure never blocks a
session: it degrades to printing nothing.

Output contract, verified against Claude Code 2.1.283's hook schemas (the
binary's zod definitions; see the release notes):

* SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit add context with
  ``{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "<event>", "additionalContext": "<text>"}}``;
* Stop continues the session with ``{"decision": "block", "reason": "<text>"}``
  (``decision`` is ``"approve" | "block"``); the re-entry carries
  ``stop_hook_active: true`` and gets nothing.

Free tier: reminders only (the debloat FYI and the unsaved-last-session line
at start, the save-due line on a prompt). Pro (a verified fresh/stale
entitlement whose tier is paid, never a file hint): the start runs the debloat
plan under the person's policy and reports one line, and names up to three
relevant skill proposals (read-only, at most once a day); Stop asks the model
to run the save procedure headless by ACTIVE time (R1, plan 2.2): once early
(the first turn end after 5 memory writes, or after a compaction of THIS
session; the write count is the account's, plan D6.5), then after
every interval of active work (default 60 minutes; `sibyl autosave`), never
more than 8 times a session or 12 a day, and only when there is something to
save (Stop fires at every turn end, not only at the end of a session). Active
time: every SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop and PreCompact adds the time
since the previous event, capped at 5 minutes, except the model's own turn
(from a prompt to its Stop), capped at 30 minutes. A scripted `claude -p` run is
never continued (no transcript, or fewer than two prompts in the session).
Each continuation carries its sequence number ("save 2 of this session"), so
the transcript guard applies per request; a request is recorded (per-session
and per-day caps, the interval) only when it is actually emitted. PreCompact
and SessionEnd write the session capsule.

Skill signals (R2, Pro): Stop also reads the transcript INCREMENTALLY from the
session's stored byte offset (at most 4 MiB per Stop) and records each
tool_use block's name and the hashed, sorted key names of its input in
~/.sibyl-memory/signals.json; values and text are never kept. The learner
never runs in a hook: the next MCP server start turns the record into
proposals.

Time bound (Claude Code kills a hook at its timeout, 5 s): nothing in a hook
touches the network. The Pro client's entitlement gate never refreshes, its
usage heartbeat is off (the exit flush would wait on the network), and a
memory write (a trim's history, a capsule) happens only when the cap gate can
decide it locally (a fresh tier cache) and within ``WRITE_BUDGET_SECONDS`` of
the hook's start; otherwise the start only plans and the write waits for a
later start or the MCP server. Measured: see the release notes.

Fast path: this module imports only the standard library. A hook first reads
the payload, the credentials and the UNVERIFIED tier claim in
entitlement.json; when that claim is not a paid tier the device cannot be Pro
(the verified tier is that same claim), so Stop returns at once and
PreCompact / SessionEnd record their counters without verifying the token or
opening the memory database. A claim that says paid is always verified.
