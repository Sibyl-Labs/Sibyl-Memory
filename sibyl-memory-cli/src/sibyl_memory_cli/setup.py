"""`sibyl setup`: auto-detect agent frameworks and wire SIBYL as memory provider.

Maximum-efficiency onboarding command. Single-command path for the user:

    pip install sibyl-memory-cli
    sibyl setup          # auto-detects Hermes, Claude Code and Codex, prompts per stack, wires

Three wirers:
  - HermesWirer:     install-plugin + edit $HERMES_HOME/config.yaml (memory.provider)
  - ClaudeCodeWirer: `claude mcp add --scope user sibyl-memory` (the discovery
                     surface); ~/.claude/settings.json holds the hooks and the
                     skills directory sits beside it
  - CodexWirer:      add [mcp_servers.sibyl_memory] to ~/.codex/config.toml

Each wirer follows the same protocol:
  is_present()       -> bool          (filesystem + PATH detect)
  current_state()    -> dict          (configured? wired-with-sibyl? current-value?)
  wire(force, dry_run, prompt_fn) -> WireOutcome

Destructive operations (overwriting an existing non-SIBYL config) default to NO
on the prompt. Fresh adds default to YES. --force overrides destructive guards.
--yes accepts all defaults (still respects the destructive-default-NO unless
--force is also passed). --dry-run prints intent without writing.

All config edits are atomic: backup to <file>.<utc-timestamp>.bak, write to
<file>.tmp, rename.
